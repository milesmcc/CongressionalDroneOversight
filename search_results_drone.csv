And those planes      that drop the bombs? The destroyers that carry the missiles?      They have pilots, captains, and crews. All humans. Even the      ``unmanned'' drones have human pilots, and the psychological      wear and tear on them is staggering. Planes take off from      airfields in foreign lands and from aircraft carriers, both      of which are staffed by thousands of American somebodies,      just like those destroyer ships. At every turn in a military      operation you will find people. Intel analysts, linguists,      flight crews, and cooks. Even war plans . . . rely on      thousands of people who will be pulled to a new duty, which      causes reshuffling far and wide in the military community.      And this, most definitely, affects our military families."

The Ukrainian Government took back the Donetsk airport in Eastern Ukraine. Then the rebels came back. And I say ``rebels'' with a wry smile. I mean this is the Russian Army. They came back and they took it again. Last week those Russian-backed rebels broke a shaky ceasefire agreement and they renewed the fighting with the Ukrainian Government military. This Senator feels that we have got to do more to help these people who are trying to protect their independence. If you recall, last year we passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act which provides further sanctions and lethal aid such as antitank and anti-armor weapons, counterartillery radars, secure communications equipment, and tactical surveillance drones. All of that was needed."

He felt he had to take him out with a drone because that American citizen--an American citizen only because his parents came here on visas--was too dangerous for them to do anything else.

7718e494aa237ef3be0ea1712c752cf4,2009-11-18,FUTURE INVOLVEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN,James,McGovern,Democrat,M,MASSACHUSETTS,411,"The U.S. ambassador in Kabul sent two classified cables to      Washington in the past week expressing deep concerns about      sending more U.S. troops to Afghanistan until President Hamid      Karzai's government demonstrates that it is willing to tackle      the corruption and mismanagement that has fueled the      Taliban's rise, senior U.S. officials said.       Karl W. Eikenberry's memos, sent as President Obama enters      the final stages of his deliberations over a new Afghanistan      strategy, illustrated both the difficulty of the decision and      the deepening divisions within the administration's national      security team. After a top-level meeting on the issue      Wednesday afternoon--Obama's eighth since early last month--     the White House issued a statement that appeared to reflect      Eikenberry's concerns.       ``The President believes that we need to make clear to the      Afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended,''      the statement said. ``After years of substantial investments      by the American people, governance in Afghanistan must      improve in a reasonable period of time.''       On the eve of his nine-day trip to Asia, Obama was given a      series of options laid out by military planners with      differing numbers of new U.S. deployments, ranging from      10,000 to 40,000 troops. None of the scenarios calls for      scaling back the U.S. presence in Afghanistan or delaying the      dispatch of additional troops.       But Eikenberry's last-minute interventions have highlighted      the nagging undercurrent of the policy discussion: the U.S.      dependence on a partnership with a Karzai government whose      incompetence and corruption is a universal concern within the      administration. After months of political upheaval, in the      wake of widespread fraud during the August presidential      election, Karzai was installed last week for a second five-     year term.       In addition to placing the Karzai problem prominently on      the table, the cables from Eikenberry, a retired three-star      general who in 2006-2007 commanded U.S. troops in      Afghanistan, have rankled his former colleagues in the      Pentagon--as well as Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, defense      officials said. McChrystal, the top U.S. and NATO commander      in Afghanistan, has stated that without the deployment of an      additional tens of thousands of troops within the next year,      the mission there ``will likely result in failure.''       Eikenberry retired from the military in April as a senior      general in NATO and was sworn in as ambassador the next day.      His position as a former commander of U.S. forces in      Afghanistan is likely to give added weight to his concerns      about sending more troops and fan growing doubts about U.S.      prospects in Afghanistan among an increasingly pessimistic      public and polarized Congress.       Although Eikenberry's extensive military experience and      previous command in Afghanistan were the key reasons Obama      chose him for the top diplomatic job there, the former      general had been reluctant as ambassador to weigh in on      military issues. Some officials who favor an increase in      troops said they were surprised by the last-minute nature of      his strongly worded cables.       In these and other communications with Washington,      Eikenberry has expressed deep reservations about Karzai's      erratic behavior and corruption within his government, said      U.S. officials familiar with the cables. Since Karzai was      officially declared reelected last week, U.S. diplomats have      seen little sign that the Afghan president plans to address      the problems they have raised repeatedly with him.       U.S. officials were particularly irritated by a interview      this week in which a defiant Karzai said that the West has      little interest in Afghanistan and that its troops are there      only for self-serving reasons.       ``The West is not here primarily for the sake of      Afghanistan,'' Karzai told PBS's ``The NewsHour With Jim      Lehrer'' program. ``It is here to fight terrorism. The United      States and its allies came to Afghanistan after September 11.      Afghanistan was troubled like hell before that, too. Nobody      bothered about us.''       Karzai expressed indifference when asked about the      withdrawal of most of the hundreds of U.N. employees from      Afghanistan after a bombing late last month in Kabul. The      blast killed five foreign U.N. officials.       ``They may or may not return,'' he said. ``I don't think      Afghanistan will notice it.''       Eikenberry also has expressed frustration with the relative      paucity of funds set aside for spending on development and      reconstruction this year in Afghanistan, a country wrecked by      three decades of war. Earlier this summer, he asked for $2.5      billion in nonmilitary spending for 2010, a 60 percent      increase over what Obama had requested from Congress, but the      request has languished even as the administration has debated      spending billions of dollars on new troops.       The ambassador also has worried that sending tens of      thousands of additional American troops would increase the      Afghan government's dependence on U.S. support at a time when      its own security forces should be taking on more      responsibility for fighting. Before serving as the commander      of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, Eikenberry was in charge of      the Afghan army training program.       Each of the four options that were presented to Obama on      Wednesday were accompanied by troop figures and the estimated      annual costs of the additional deployments, roughly      calculated as $1 billion per thousand troops. All would draw      the United States deeper into the war at a time of economic      hardship and rising fiscal concerns at home.       Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense      Secretary Robert M. Gates have backed a major increase in      U.S. forces to drive the Taliban from populated areas and      provide Afghan security forces and the government the space      to snuff out corruption and undertake development projects.      They have argued that only a large-scale counterinsurgency      effort can produce a strong Afghan government capable of      preventing the country from once again become an al-Qaeda      haven.       Those views have been balanced in internal deliberations by      the hard skepticism of other Obama advisers, led by Vice      President Biden. They have argued for a more narrow      counterterrorism strategy that would not significantly expand      the U.S. combat presence.       The most ambitious option Obama received Wednesday calls      for 40,000 additional U.S. troops, as outlined by McChrystal      in his stark assessment of the war filed in late August.       Military planners put the additional annual cost of      McChrystal's recommendation at $33 billion, although White      House officials say the number is probably closer to $50      billion. The extra troops would allow U.S. forces to attempt      to take back and hold several Taliban havens in the southern      and eastern regions of Afghanistan.       One compromise option put forward by the Pentagon, with the      backing of Gates, would deploy an additional 30,000 to 35,000      U.S. troops--fewer than McChrystal's optimal number to carry      out his strategy--and rely on NATO allies to make up the      5,000- to 10,000-troop difference. The third option, known by      military planners as ``the hybrid,'' would send 20,000      additional U.S. troops to shore up security in 10 to 12 major      population areas. In the rest of the country, the military      would adopt a counterterrorism strategy targeting forces      allied with the Taliban and al-Qaeda, primarily in the north      and east, with fighter jets, Predator drones and Special      Operations troops that leave a light U.S. footprint on the      ground. The military puts the annual cost of that option at      $22 billion.       The most modest option calls for deploying an additional      10,000 to 15,000 troops. While under consideration at the      White House, the proposal holds little merit for military      planners because, after building bases to accommodate 10,000      or so additional soldiers and Marines, the marginal cost of      adding troops beyond that figure would rise only slightly."

8433a7d4b3f4d645609f9f9a39223f4e,2010-05-26,HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF JOHN VINCENT PANGELINAN GERBER,Madeleine,Bordallo,Democrat,F,GUAM,222,"Let me begin by saying what a distinct honor it is to stand      before you on this altar today in the presence of this      beloved and storied Marine, and represent with this eulogy      the memories, sorrow, gratitudes and condolences of all      United States Marines around the globe who have had the      privilege of knowing John Gerber. And I use the past tense      loosely here, because there are many United States Marines      yet to come who will also undoubtedly have the privilege of      getting to know John and his legacy while visiting his      Pacific War Museum--an unyielding and enduring structure of      steel and iron, lovingly filled with artifacts of sacrifice      and recollections of wartime faithful devotion--built by John      Gerber's hands, to withstand the rigors of time. In many      ways, John and the Museum itself are one in the same--     steadfast, lasting, loyal, engaging, welcoming, enlightening,      forgiving, hallowed, and revered. Timeless qualities that      transcend any earthly existence.       I first heard the name ``John Gerber'' about four years ago      in 2006 in an unlikely place. I was sitting in the Incheon      International Airport in Seoul, Korea awaiting a late-night      flight to Guam for Alliance talks between senior U.S. and      Korean military leaders. The mere fact that I remember that      moment speaks volumes about John, in and of itself. I wasn't      part of the specific conversation at the airport, and like      most staff officers who carry the laptops and briefing books      for the senior officers, I was only pretending to be      attentive as I sat on the periphery of two general officers,      one couch over in the airport terminal, who were engaged in      what appeared to me to be largely irrelevant banter. Amidst      the sleep-inducing drone I suddenly heard a sentence that      leaped-out at me with alarming clarity and purpose:      ``Nobody's done more for the Marine Corps' legacy on Guam      than John Gerber.'' Needless to say, I was intrigued and      leaned-in to see if I could hear more. With frustration,      however, I leaned back in my chair as the sentence ended      right there, with the two Generals nodding to each other in      stern, solemn agreement. My intrigue would have to remain      unsolved--one of the unfortunate aspects of ``experience''      in the Marine Corps--for I had learned many years before      that it would not have been wise at that moment for the      LtCol--one couch over--to interrupt two Generals engaged      in a private conversation by asking: ``Excuse me, Sir--Who      is John Gerber?''       2nd Lieutenant Loynd might have asked. . . .       But the sentence stayed with me, and it wouldn't be until      April of last year in 2009 that I would finally gain the      honor of meeting The Man. Since then, I have found myself      often repeating the same sentence, in my own conversations,      with the same clarity, distinction and purpose that I heard      it with four years ago: ``Nobody's done more for the Marine      Corps' legacy on Guam than John Gerber.'' Truer words were      never spoken.       Knowing what I know now about John and what he means to the      Marine Corps and our heritage, I should have interrupted the      generals four years ago with my question. Instead of the      expected steely-eyed glare for interrupting, I'm certain that      I would have been educated in a heartfelt way about the Man      and his incredible legacy. The General's response most likely      would have been something like: ``Well Bob, let me tell you      about my friend John Gerber. . . .''       What he would have told me would have been a reverent tale      about a man who devotes every waking moment of his life to      serving others, to honoring the legacy of sacrifice and      commitment by those veterans who demonstrated the full      measure of devotion to their country and their comrades, and      about a man who loves the Marine Corps and his fellow Marines      with every fiber of his being.       When I did finally meet John in April of 2009 at his      museum, I immediately sensed something unique--that I was in      the presence of a man so humble and modest, but yet so      commanding and persuasive at the same time. I was on an      advanced visit to Guam a couple of months prior to moving      here from my assignment at Headquarters Marine Corps. My      predecessor on Guam, Col. Paul Brier, made sure to bring me      to the Museum to meet John on the very first day of my visit.      We were immediately greeted by John around the back, his      Marine Corps ball cap tilted back on his head, his gray      ``Marines'' t-shirt soaked through with sweat and covered      with twigs, mulch, and sawdust. I was meeting a man of the      earth, imbued with an ethic of labor and hard work. Shaking      his hand, the roughness of his palm immediately told me the      story. But I was also meeting a man of tremendous intellect,      as I learned more in the first five minutes about Guam's      cross-cultural history and conflicts than my jet-lagged brain      could absorb. We went through the museum and I was machine-     gunned by John with not only Marine history about the 3rd      Marine Division at Asan and the 1st Marine Provisional      Brigade at Agat, but very personal tales of courage, heroism,      love and devotion. Of men like Medal of Honor recipient Capt.      Louis Wilson, and Catholic Priest Father Duenas; about      hometown Chamorro Marine Corps officers and leaders such as      Capt. Peter Siguenza and BGen Ben Blaz, about Underwood and      Puller and about the 1,548 United States Marines who      gallantly gave their lives in the Liberation of Guam. And      true to his character, John presented a balanced and open-     minded perspective, as we transitioned to the other wing of      the museum where I was overwhelmed with his equally in-depth      knowledge of the Japanese perspectives of the war.       Our relationship would grow over the next year and I would      routinely turn to John for help in ensuring that our visiting      Marines--his Marines--were well taken care of.       Two months ago, I was asked to write a letter of      recommendation to support the nomination of John to receive      the prestigious ``Colonel John H. Magruder III Award'' from      the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation in Quantico, Virginia.      Once again, I found myself using that famous sentence from      Korea. And I quote the final paragraph of my letter of      recommendation:       ``Over the course of the past two decades, no person has      done more to honor the history and reputation of the United      States Marine Corps on Guam than John Gerber. His Pacific War      Museum remains a sole outpost of Marine Corps heritage in the      vast Mid-Pacific. Visited by commandants, generals,      congressmen, Marines, history enthusiasts, tourists, children      and citizens of various nations alike, John's museum both      inspires and brings contemplative reflection. For his      tireless devotion to depicting the legacy, service and      history of the United States Marine Corps in the Pacific, I      can think of no finer recipient of the ``Colonel John H.      Magruder III Award'' than John Gerber.''       I have high hopes that this award will come true. But in my      mind, there was no greater local recognition of John's      devotion than to see him and Mel sitting next to BGen Ben      Blaz as Guests of Honor for the performance of the storied      Marine Corps Battle Color Detachment at Asan Beach this past      March--a first ever performance on Guam that could not have      been a success, without, once again, John Gerber's legendary      passion, love, devotion and work-ethic. John singlehandedly      prepared the Asan Park for a performance befitting the      Marines from 8th and I. And because of that --they will be      back. And I know they will be playing a tune for John.        Rudyard Kipling once wrote:"

             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007",Doris,Matsui,Democrat,F,CALIFORNIA,99,"Fort Stewart, GA.--The pressures that the conflict in Iraq      is putting on the Army are apparent amid the towering pine      trees of southeast Georgia, where the Third Infantry Division      is preparing for the likelihood that it will go back to Iraq      for a third tour.       Col. Tom James, who commands the division's Second Brigade,      acknowledged that his unit's equipment levels had fallen so      low that it now had no tanks or other armored vehicles to use      in training and that his soldiers were rated as largely      untrained in attack and defense.       The rest of the division, which helped lead the invasion of      Iraq in 2003 and conducted the first probes into Baghdad, is      moving back to full strength after many months of being a      shell of its former self.       But at a time when Pentagon officials are saying the Army      is stretched so thin that it may be forced to go back on its      pledge to limit National Guard deployment overseas, the      division's situation is symptomatic of how the shortages are      playing out on the ground.       The enormous strains on equipment and personnel, because of      longer-than-expected deployments, have left active Army units      with little combat power in reserve. The Second Brigade, for      example, has only half of the roughly 3,500 soldiers it is      supposed to have. The unit trains on computer simulators,      meant to recreate the experience of firing a tank's main gun      or driving in a convoy under attack.       ``It's a good tool before you get the equipment you need,''      Colonel James said. But a few years ago, he said, having a      combat brigade in a mechanized infantry division at such a      low state of readiness would have been ``unheard of.''       Other than the 17 brigades in Iraq and Afghanistan, only      two or three combat brigades in the entire Army--perhaps      7,000 to 10,000 troops--are fully trained and sufficiently      equipped to respond quickly to crises, said a senior Army      general.       Most other units of the active-duty Army, which is growing      to 42 brigades, are resting or being refitted at their home      bases. But even that cycle, which is supposed to take two      years, is being compressed to a year or less because of the      need to prepare units quickly to return to Iraq.       After coming from Iraq in 2003, the Third Infantry Division      was sent back in 2005. Then, within weeks of returning home      last January, it was told by the Army that one of its four      brigades had to be ready to go back again, this time in only      11 months. The three other brigades would have to be ready by      mid-2007, Army planners said.       Yet almost all of the division's equipment had been left in      Iraq for their replacements, and thousands of its soldiers      left the Army or were reassigned shortly after coming home,      leaving the division largely hollow. Most senior officers      were replaced in June.       In addition to preparing for Iraq, the Army assigned the      division other missions it had to be ready to execute,      including responding to hurricanes and other natural      disasters and deploying to Korea if conflict broke out there.       Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, who took command in June, says      officials at Army headquarters ask him every month how ready      his division is to handle a crisis in Korea. The answer,      General Lynch says, is that he is getting there.       Since this summer, 1,000 soldiers a month have been      arriving at Fort Stewart, 400 of them just out of basic      training. As a result, the First and Third Brigades are now      at or near their authorized troop strength, but many of the      soldiers are raw.       The two brigades started receiving tanks and other      equipment to begin training in the field only in the last      month, leaving the division only partly able to respond      immediately if called to Korea, General Lynch said.       ``I'm confident two of the four brigade combat teams would      say, `O.K., let's go,' '' General Lynch said in an interview.      ``The Second and Fourth Brigades would say, `O.K., boss, but      we've got no equipment. What are we going to use?' So we'd      have to figure out where we're going to draw their      equipment.''       Meanwhile, the division is also preparing for deployment to      Iraq on an abbreviated timeline.       The brief time at home does not sit well with some      soldiers. Specialist George Patterson, who reenlisted after      returning from Iraq in January, said last week that he was      surprised to learn he could end up being home with his wife      and daughter for only a year.       ``I knew I would be going back,'' Specialist Patterson      said. ``Did I think I would leave and go back in the same      year? No. It kind of stinks.''       Instead of allowing more than a year to prepare to deploy,      the First Brigade training schedule has been squeezed into      only a few months, so the brigade can be ready to deploy as      ordered by early December. Though the unit has not yet been      formally designated for Iraq, most soldiers say there is      little doubt they are headed there early next year.       Some combat-skills training not likely to be used in Iraq      has been shortened substantially, said Col. John Charlton,      the brigade commander. ``It's about taking all the      requirements and compressing them, which is a challenge,'' he      said.       The timetable also leaves officers and their soldiers less      time to form close relationships that can be vital, several      officers said.       And soldiers have less time to learn their weapons systems.      Many of the major weapons systems, like artillery and even      tanks, are unlikely to be used frequently in a      counterinsurgency fight like Iraq.        The division has only a few dozen fully armored Humvees for      training because most of the vehicles are in use in Iraq. Nor      does it have all the tanks and trucks it is supposed to have      when at full strength.       ``There is enough equipment, and I would almost say just      enough equipment,'' said Lt. Col. Sean Morrissey, the      division's logistics officer. ``We're accustomed to, `I need      100 trucks. Where's my hundred trucks?' Well, we're nowhere      near that.''       Last week, in training areas deep in the Fort Stewart      woods, First Brigade soldiers were still learning to use      other systems important in Iraq, like unmanned aerial      vehicles, which are used for conducting surveillance.       Standing at a training airfield with three of the aircraft      nearby, Sgt. Mark Melbourne, the senior noncommissioned      officer for the brigade's unmanned aerial vehicles platoon,      said only 6 of the brigade's 15 operators had qualified so      far in operating the aircraft from a ground station.       All of them are supposed to be qualified by next month, but      the training has been slowed by frequent rain, Sergeant      Melbourne said.       This week, the First Brigade began a full-scale mission      rehearsal for Iraq.       Normally, armored units preparing for Iraq are sent to Fort      Irwin, Calif., for such training, but transporting a      brigade's worth of equipment and soldiers there takes a      month, which the schedule would not permit.       So the trainers and Arabic-speaking role players, who will      simulate conditions the unit is likely to encounter in Iraq,      were brought here to conduct the three-week exercise in a      Georgia pine forest, rather than in the California desert."

I think it is important for the President to answer that clearly; again, not because I am implying he did know, because I think if they leave that out there, it creates questions that should not be created. I hope they will do that. It is important."

I retired from service in public health as a      microbiologist, research scientist, administrator and      academic a few years ago. I am now active in work for human      rights. These rights are not peculiar to a people or country;      they protect the entire human race. I am expressing below my      concerns over the likelihood of damage to long-term interests      of the United States of America, its allies, the NATO forces,      Canada in particular. The pain of sufferings families of      North America, in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia is      hard to ignore. The irony is that the more the U.S. tried to      ameliorate conditions, the worse they have become.       The people of North America know very well the objectives      of the United States (U.S.) and the hurdles faced in leading      the world during much of the 20th and in the current 21st      centuries. The people of the U.S. and their elected leaders      have devoted a lot of time, money and precious resources in      manpower and management for the good of the mankind to make      the world better and safer. Despite all the good intentions      of the democratic world it has been struggling to find a      basis for lasting world peace. I believe that the long-term      interests of the United States and the world at large are      complementary. The U.S. leadership is good for the world.      Yet, increasingly fewer people believe that to be true. Is      there anything amiss?       I firmly believe that the United States and its allies      eagerly want to prevent the sufferings of friendly peoples      whose governments they have influence over. While we find the      stern hand of the U.S. military operating against enemies,      there is little effort to impose the same principles of human      freedom and dignity on ``friends''. Much of South Asia is      democratic; India boasts of being the largest democracy in      the world. Yet it is in India--more than anywhere else--where      democracy has been used to deny freedom, national and human      rights, and basic human dignity to the majority. As the Hon.      Dana Rohrabacher, (R-Cal) had said as far as the minorities      (the Sikhs, Muslims in general, Muslims of the      Internationally Disputed Areas of Jammu and Kashmir,      Christians, Dalits, Adivasasis or the indigenous native      people, and other non-Hindu, non-Brahmin) are concerned,      India is a Nazi Germany for them (Tim Phares 2006 Int J Sikh      Affairs 16(1),40-42 ISSN 1481-5435).       Congressman Rohrabacher's assessment is accurate and well      justified; it can be the focal point of a new beginning with      India. The question is: how could a country, which is the      world's largest democracy, sustain caste apartheid and      pogroms against minorities without facing recrimination? It      is done by mis-definition and misrepresentation the world is      too busy to try and unravel. India is not a nation and has      not even tried to become a nation during the 60 years that it      has been ``free''. It has relied entirely on brute military      force to crush any people that demanded its rights. The fact      is the Muslims are a majority in Jammu and Kashmir, the Sikhs      are a majority in the Punjab and Hill tribes of Assam are      mostly Christian. The People of Jammu and Kashmir were      promised a plebiscite that was endorsed by the United      Nations. The Sikhs were promised their separate state      Khalistan by the Congress leaders in exchange for rejecting      Pakistan's offer of the same. The Tribal peoples of Assam      were also promised ``freedom'' if they sided with the      Congress Party against the British. Now that these peoples      demand what was promised, India has unleashed the most      diabolical genocide and an international campaign to demonize      their stuggle. The British Raj lasted as long as it did      because it was founded on recognition of India as multiple      nations. How can a country call itself a democracy when it      discards its very foundation--the right of national self-     determination?       India aspires for its leaders--M.K. Ghandi and J.L. Nehru--     to be recognized with other great leaders of the democratic      world like George Washington, Franklin D Roosevelt, Abraham      Lincoln, J.F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, and William Jefferson      Clinton. But it cannot even begin to secure that position      until it can show that they stood up for the oppressed within      the country and without. India has invaded each one its      neighbours, overtly or covertly; if it gave in to any demand,      it sought to hurt twice as much elsewhere. The Untouchables      or Dalits--who are a majority in several states of India and      constitute 65 % of its population--were promised      ``reservation'' of seats in the parliament, in education and      jobs. Even after 60 years, it is still denied to backward      castes and to Muslims. India uses ``democracy'' as means to      fudge issues and deny rights by never ending arguments in      circles. That is the experience of the people in the country      and neighbours who live in dread of roads being closed or      rivers being diverted.       The devious policies and broken promises is the hallmark of      India today. The Sikhs have been the worst victims. They      founded the first secular and sovereign state in South Asia      by Sikh monarch Ranjit Singh in 1799 that was ``annexed'' by      treaty to the British Empire on 14th March, 1849. In June      1984, the Darbar Sahib Complex which includes the Supreme      Seat of Sikh Polity, The Akal Takht Sahib, Amritsar      (mistakenly known as Golden Temple of Amritsar), which is the      Vatican of the Sikh faith, was assaulted by the Indian Army      killing 20,000 devotees who were inside the temple and their      leader Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale was martyred. When the      Sikh guards of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi avenged the      assault assassinating her, the worst pogrom was unleashed      upon the Sikhs all over India that resulted in 250,000      Sikhs--mostly young men and their families--who were      mercilessly killed, Indian diplomats talk about the tradition      of non-violence in India of which Mahatma Gandhi is      considered to be a universal symbol. But the truth is that      India is violent but only to the weak; when confronted with      strong and powerful the Brahmin response is obsequious      folding of hands. This manner of greeting appears to be show      of humillty. But it is actually a statement that the person      being greeted is of low birth and is untouchable.       On 15th of August 1947, the British handed over political      power to the ``unelected'' Hindu leadership. But the Hindus/     Brahmins (neither a religion nor a culture) were only 15 % of      the population; how could they be the successors of the      British Empire in India. Once installed in power, they      have relied on a combination of hate (for people of      foreign faiths or of low birth), guile and stratagem far      mor complex than any Machiavelli. The record of their rule      over India speaks eloquently how Hindus/Brahmins have been      master-mind in persecution of faith minorities and the low      caste majority of native peoples who are deemed to be      inferior by birth in their unique faith. Through Article      25 of the Indian Constitution 1950, the Sikh, the      Buddhists and Jains and all the Untouchables, all of who      are victims of oppression and apartheid, are denied their      separate identity and deemed to be Hindus. The Sikh faith      founded by Guru Nanak Sahib was a rebellion to reject the      caste ``apartheid'' enforced by the Hindus of Brahmin      caste. The irony is that when freedom came, the Sikhs were      declared to be Hindus (long haired Hindus) albeit of the      renegade variety, against the teachings of its founder,      Guru Nanak Sahib, and the Sikhs' Holy Scripture, Adi Guru      Granth Sahib. It is difficult to portray      the anger, revulsion and frustration felt by the Sikhs in      this unwelcome embrace of Hinduism (which is neither a      religion nor a culture according to the verdict of Punjab      and Haryana High Court, 1984). Brahmin rule in post-15th      August, 1947, India has interest only in maintaining the      apartheid system; its objective is the prosperity of urban      dwelling upper castes--the so called 200 million middle      class.       Suave Indian diplomats routinely underlines that the USA      and India are natural allies. Even American politicians and      diplomats have started to harp on the same theme. It is time,      this was questioned. What makes them natural allies? During      the years of the Cold War, India was the friend of The Soviet      Union, not of America. Why? It is because both were      internally and internationlly imperialist. Now, India needs      an imperial patron to underpin its own imperious. It needs      the U.S. Is that the role the USA sees for itself in the      world? As supporter of local imperialists? Surely the power      and prestige of the USA is such that it must aim higher:      obtain lasting universal peace and harmony; amity between      faiths; unfettered democracy; free trade. Tied to apron      strings of India, the USA is bound to drift into petty      machinations to deny freedom to some and equality to all.      lndia's imperialism is founded on delaying tactics and      betrayal. All the problems in the South Asian region are      product of Brahmin spin or stratagem. The media makes wild      forecasts of India of the future. It is supposed to be a huge      market for consumer goods. Whose? Peoples' Republic of China?       Some people have become very rich in India. Diaspora      Indians are clever and are also becoming rich. But for the      majority, India is a hellhole and will always remain so.      Caste based India has structural, infrastructual and social      problems that it cannot overcome until it abandons its      ``poverty imperialism''. However, India is country of 1.1      billion people who deserve better. If India allowed the right      of self-determination to the Sikhs, to the peoples of Jammu      and Kashmir and Assam, it would still be the second largest      country with population more than all of Europe. However, it      would no longer need to maintain hostility with neighbouring      states and would be in a position to remove strife, tension      and hate from its social scene. India must give the native      peoples their national rights and create autonomous states of      India that would facilitate a compact of states within each      the interplay of diverse ethnic and caste interests would      create grass root harmony.       For the United States to articulate its interests in far      off lands and develop mechanisms to secure those interests,      its diplomats and politicians have to be conversant with the      history and customs of those lands. Historically, the Sikhs      of Punjab and the people of Afghanistan have never been      ``subservient'' to any foreign ruler. That was true in the      19th Century as it is today. There are nearly 20      nations within the ``Indian union'', which are struggling      to regain their lost sovereignty and independence ever      since the British Indian Empire was hurriedly partitioned      in 1947. The end of the British Empire marked the end of      the imperial era in the whole world. India's efforts to      build and expand its empire are the biggest threat to      peace and stability of Asia. Consider Mr. President, if 20      or so nations, including the Sikhs of Punjab, Christians      of Nagaland, the tribal people of Assam and Manipur, the      south Indian states most notably Tamil Nadu, were to      become ``sovereign'' states, what a huge change for the      better it would be for the region and the world. That is      the only way to replace the polity of hate and oppression      with polities of peace and harmony underpinned by secure      undefended borders. Large is not fashionable; not just for      women.       I hope I have given some points to ponder. The USA can lead      the world with a global vision. There are not many regions      where so much is old and archaic ready to crumble and hit      dust. Many Americans are fond of India but they do not know      why? The present rulers of India would like your help in      building their empire. But that is not the best interest of      the people of India. India is one country that needs benign      intervention to dismantle the social and political structures      to be replaced by structures founded on national self-     determination. That would be good for business; that would be      good for world peace; that is the calling of greatness.       Best wishes and warmest regards.           Sincerely,                                              Awatar Singh Sekhon,     Ph.D, FlBA, RM (CCM), Associate Professor (Retired), Medical          Microbiology and Immunology; Director (Former), National      Centre for Human Mycotic Diseases Canada; Managing Editor and      Acting Editor in Chief."

McKiernan, former Commander of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and former Commander, U.S. Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A), he emphasized that the most important tools needed to successfully conduct operations are more ``eyes in the sky,'' also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Most importantly, this request will help save lives through better intelligence gathering and greater strike capabilities. Furthermore, Predator C means more jobs contributing to San Diego's local economy. Predator C will provide the USAF and other customers with an additional covert capability, enhanced by much higher operational and transit speeds for quick response and quick repositioning for improved mission flexibility and survivability."

ec65cfcb3d67aa318fcaf789e3eb6827,2011-05-09,REDUCING THE DEBT,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Osama bin Laden's killing was a great moment for America      and for decent people around the world. But allowing the      euphoria of that moment to drive us to irresponsible      decisions in South Asia would be devastating to America's      interests and security. Al Qaeda has not yet been dismantled      or defeated.       Osama bin Laden's death has no implications for the number      of American or international forces in Afghanistan, for their      mission, or for the timeline for their reduction. George W.      Bush sent forces into Afghanistan not to kill bin Laden, but      to oust al Qaeda from its safe haven there, defeat that      organization, and create political conditions that would      preclude its return to Afghanistan. Barack Obama reaffirmed      that mission in his December 2009 speech setting out the      current strategy. He chose a counter-insurgency approach      because a return of the Taliban regime to Afghanistan would      allow al Qaeda to re-establish safe havens there, whether      drawing on the historical friendliness between the two or the      inability of the Taliban to prevent their return to the      country. Furthermore, the protracted, virulent insurgency      creates opportunities for al Qaeda-linked Pakistani proxies      such as the Haqqani network to invigorate international      terrorist groups and use them in the fight in Afghanistan.      President Obama has been pursuing the right strategy, and the      forces the United States and its international partners have      committed to executing it are--just barely--adequate to      achieve it.       The outcome of the war in Afghanistan hangs in the balance.      American forces and their allies made dramatic gains last      year, clearing the Taliban out of safe havens throughout      southern Afghanistan, their heartland. Eastern Afghanistan,      where al Qaeda-linked groups have a stronger presence, has      also seen considerable progress. Contrary to some media      reporting, neither al Qaeda nor Lashkar-e-Taiba has      established safe havens in the wake of the withdrawal of U.S.      forces from isolated river valleys in Kunar Province. In      fact, a series of offensive operations in the valleys and the      province has inflicted great harm on elements of those      organizations. Kunar's capital, Asadabad, is a growing and      increasingly thriving town, as we saw on a recent visit. And      Afghan Army troops have remained in some of the outposts from      which U.S. forces withdrew, demonstrating their determination      to control their own territory.       Although al Qaeda has not reestablished sanctuaries in      Afghanistan, it has not been for lack of trying. U.S. forces      only recently killed a senior Afghan al Qaeda official in      Kunar, and there is ample evidence that al Qaeda and Lashkar-     e-Taiba, among other Islamist groups, would welcome the      opportunity to set themselves up in a lawless Afghanistan      once again. The need to help Afghans establish a state that      can prevent the reemergence of terrorist sanctuaries remains      after bin Laden's death, and the current strategy, adequately      resourced, is the only way to achieve that goal. Calling for      accelerating the withdrawal is tantamount to declaring that      Afghanistan has become irrelevant with bin Laden's death and      that succeeding there is no longer important for America's      security.       Consequently, there is a great deal of fighting ahead.      Continued military engagements are needed to make precarious      improvements enduring and handle other challenges. The enemy      will work hard this year to retake its lost sanctuaries in      the south, to conduct spectacular attacks in Kabul and      elsewhere, and to strengthen its remaining safe havens in the      east. Our forces will try to hold and expand security gains      in the south and make progress in the east, but conditions      are not set for any major reductions in those forces.       If there is cause for cautious optimism in Afghanistan,      there are ample grounds for pessimism on the other fronts in      the struggle with militant Islamism. Bin Laden's presence in      Pakistan has once again concentrated the minds of Americans      on the fact that Pakistan's leadership has yet to come to      consensus about the need to combat and defeat militant      Islamist groups within Pakistan's borders. Nor has the United      States developed any real strategy for addressing this      challenge. We can hardly expand the campaign of targeted      strikes further, particularly after the recent raid deep into      Pakistani territory. And the drone campaign will not      defeat the virulent terrorist groups it is attacking.      Overreacting to suspicions of Pakistani complicity in bin      Laden's presence in Abbottabad by suspending all aid or      military ties or by taking other drastic actions would      make it much harder, not easier, to operate against the      terrorists who threaten us.       On the contrary, withdrawing forces from Afghanistan and      cutting all aid to Pakistan would merely reinforce two of the      most prevalent conspiracy theories in South Asia--that the      United States will always abandon those who rely on it, and      that we were only there to get bin Laden anyway. We should,      instead, build on the symbolic victory of killing bin Laden      by following through with the president's strategy to      dismantle and defeat the militant Islamist groups supported      as proxies by some in the Pakistani security apparatus. Only      by defeating those proxies can we reasonably hope to compel      Pakistan to reevaluate its security interests and develop a      policy to oppose and suppress all militant Islamists      operating within its borders.       But al Qaeda has not confined itself to its sanctuaries in      Pakistan and Afghanistan. Al Qaeda thrives in political      weakness and has been in the process of expanding around the      globe. The core al Qaeda group of which bin Laden was the      head (often referred to as Al Qaeda Central) has long had at      best only a tenuous control over the operations of its      dispersed franchises. That control rested partly on resources      Al Qaeda Central directed, partly on the value of its      recognition of a particular group as worthy of the al Qaeda      brand, but largely on the symbolic importance of the      charismatic bin Laden. Bin Laden's likely successor, Egyptian      doctor Ayman al-Zawahiri, is far less charismatic. His      accession to the leadership role could prompt a competition      between Al Qaeda Central and its franchises over which group      really is at the center of the movement. Such competitions,      unfortunately, unfold in the form of spectacular attacks,      particularly those conducted on the territory of Western      states.       Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), in Yemen, is the      most active and perhaps the most dangerous al Qaeda franchise      in the world. The Arab Spring has reached Yemen with a      vengeance--massive protests have led to the defection of      elements of the Yemeni military, with the result that armed      forces are concentrating for potential civil war in and      around the capital and elsewhere in the country. Attempts to      broker a negotiated departure for Yemen's hated president,      Ali Abdullah Saleh, have broken down. It is far from clear      that any such agreement would keep the peace there for very      long in any case. Already Saleh has brought back to his      capital some of the elite, U.S.-trained Special Forces units      supposedly dedicated to the fight against AQAP. As the work      of Katherine Zimmerman at AEI's Critical Threats Project has      shown, almost any likely scenario going forward will give      AQAP more freedom to train, plan, stage, and conduct attacks      from increasingly lawless tribal areas in which it has      considerable local support. The combination of Yemen's slide      toward state failure and bin Laden's death could create a      tremendous opportunity for AQAP. His death may also lead to      an increase in AQAP's efforts to conduct spectacular attacks      against the United States and the West.       Another al Qaeda affiliate already has control over large      portions of a state: Al Shabab is the de facto government of      much of southern Somalia outside of Mogadishu. It has not      been formally recognized as an al Qaeda franchise, but its      ties with AQAP are long and deep, and its ideology closely      mirrors al Qaeda's. Shabab is kept from controlling all of      southern and central Somalia only by the presence of      peacekeepers from Uganda and Burundi, who have been barely      able to hold parts of the capital. Shabab is unlikely to      suffer at all from bin Laden's death, but it may see a      chance--or feel the need--to expand the reach of its strikes      in sympathetic retaliation.       Al Qaeda in Iraq, fortunately, remains relatively      ineffective, despite efforts to revive itself as American      forces withdraw. But the continued presence even of American      military trainers in Iraq after the end of this year remains      in doubt, and it is not clear that the Iraqi military on its      own will be able to maintain the necessary degree of pressure      on that al Qaeda franchise. If the complete withdrawal of      American forces now underway leads to the explosion of ethnic      conflict between Iraqi Arabs and Kurds, as some analysts      fear, Al Qaeda in Iraq could find fertile ground to      reestablish itself, undoing the progress we have made since "

Warren Weinstein dedicated over 40 years of his life to international development work. Throughout his career, he worked with vulnerable populations throughout Africa and South Asia. He served as Peace Corps country director in Togo and the Ivory Coast. Most recently, he spent 10 years working on economic development projects as an adviser to J.E. Austin Associates, a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) contractor, in Pakistan.   Mr. Weinstein's life and approach to development work showcased the ideals of the institutions that he served: USAID, the Peace Corps, and others. He left the comforts of home and dedicated his career to improving the lives of others in countries that were not his own. He spoke seven languages and immersed himself in the local culture of the countries in which he worked. By all accounts, he had a warm, outgoing personality and a deep commitment to solving some of the world's most difficult problems.   Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for the whole House in offering our deepest condolences to Mr. Weinstein's family and friends, especially his wife Elaine, their daughters Alisa and Jennifer, and their families. His legacy will live on in Pakistan, Togo, the Ivory Coast, and the entire range of countries in which he worked, and his service to our country and the world will never be forgotten. "

The President discussed for the first time publicly information that many of our colleagues who work with intelligence issues have been aware of for quite some time. That involves Saddam Hussein's aggressive efforts to develop and use unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs, as a delivery method for his weapons of mass destruction. The SCUDs did not have a very long range. The SCUDs were not very accurate. I can attest to that because one night visiting with General Schwarzkopf during Desert Storm in Saudi Arabia, a SCUD was launched near our site, and it landed not too far away; but it was far enough away that it did not hurt anybody. So we know that the SCUDs were not that accurate. UAVs are a different story. UAVs have a much longer range; UAVs are able to be piloted and trained specifically on a target. UAVs are dangerous. And if my colleagues do not think UAVs have a long range, we ourselves have flown a UAV from the United States to Australia and back. Saddam is aggressively seeking ability to use those long-range UAVs to put so many more targets in his sights. We cannot let that happen."

According to intelligence, Iraq has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of the 150 kilometer restriction imposed by the United Nations in the ceasefire resolution. Although Iraq's chemical weapons capability was reduced during the UNSCOM inspections, Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort over the last 4 years. Evidence suggests that it has begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including mustard gas, sarin, cyclosarin, and VX. Intelligence reports show that Iraq has invested more heavily in its biological weapons programs over the 4 years, with the result that all key aspects of this program--R, production and weaponization--are active. Most elements of the program are larger and more advanced than they were before the gulf war. Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating agents and is capable of quickly producing and weaponizing a variety of such agents, including anthrax, for delivery on a range of vehicles such as bombs, missiles, aerial sprayers, and covert operatives which could bring them to the United States homeland. Since inspectors left, the Iraqi regime has energized its missile program, probably now consisting of a few dozen Scud-type missiles with ranges of 650 to 900 kilometers that could hit Israel, Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the region. In addition, Iraq is developing unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs, capable of delivering chemical and biological warfare agents, which could threaten Iraq's neighbors as well as American forces in the Persian Gulf."

I salute you . . . We of the Army      Air Force are proud of you. We will never forget our debt to      you.'';       (21) with victory in WWII almost certain, on December 20,      1944, the WASP were quietly and unceremoniously disbanded;       (22) there were no honors, no benefits, and very few      ``thank you's'';       (23) just as they had paid their own way to enter training,      they had to pay their own way back home after their honorable      service to the military;       (24) the WASP military records were immediately sealed,      stamped ``classified'' or ``secret'', and filed away in      Government archives, unavailable to the historians who wrote      the history of WWII or the scholars who compiled the history      text books used today, with many of the records not      declassified until the 1980s;       (25) consequently, the WASP story is a missing chapter in      the history of the Air Force, the history of aviation, and      the history of the United States of America;       (26) in 1977, 33 years after the WASP were disbanded, the      Congress finally voted to give the WASP the veteran status      they had earned, but these heroic pilots were not invited to      the signing ceremony at the White House, and it was not until      7 years later that their medals were delivered in the mail in      plain brown envelopes;       (27) in the late 1970s, more than 30 years after the WASP      flew in World War II, women were finally permitted to attend      military pilot training in the United States Armed Forces;       (28) thousands of women aviators flying support aircraft      have benefitted from the service of the WASP and followed in      their footsteps;       (29) in 1993, the WASP were once again referenced during      congressional hearings regarding the contributions that women      could make to the military, which eventually led to women      being able to fly military fighter, bomber, and attack      aircraft in combat;       (30) hundreds of United States servicewomen combat pilots      have seized the opportunity to fly fighter aircraft in recent      conflicts, all thanks to the pioneering steps taken by the "

I experienced one      such moment 10 years ago when the first B-2, the Spirit of      Missouri, arrived here at Whiteman Air Force Base.       Today we commemorate both the 10th anniversary of the B-2      Bomber mission at Whiteman and the 100th anniversary of man's      first powered flight by the Wright Brothers. What an amazing      parallel that 2 men, Wilbur and Orville Wright, began the      saga of flight 100 years ago, and today the most powerful      military weapon in the world, the B-2, is manned by only 2      airmen.       It seems like airplanes have always been a great part of my      life and make up some of my fondest memories. I imagine there      are quite a few people in this room who feel the same way. I      will never forget one particular warm, autumn day in my      hometown of Lexington. I was 11 years of age, and I was with      my buddies on the north side of Franklin Avenue, across from      my home, when I heard and saw the Army Air Corps C-47s      pulling gliders above us.       I knew then that the Army Air Corps had a base near Sedalia      where these planes were located. I later learned that those      pilots were training for the June 6, 1944, D-Day invasion of      Normandy. In my wildest dreams, I could never have imagined      that years after seeing those planes fly over Lexington, I      would be a part of making that Sedalia Army Air Field, now      known as Whiteman, the most modern bomber base in the world.       My very first job was at the old Lexington Airport, which      was located across the Missouri River. My duties included      washing the Piper Cubs and Aeroncas and periodically raking      the dirt floors of the hangars. I well remember a WAAF, a      member of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, ferrying a Culver      Cadet airplane which landed at Lexington Airport to refuel.      On the right seat of this airplane, which had a 27-foot      wingspread, there was a large set of radio equipment. This      massive equipment allowed the plane to serve as a drone,      pulling targets for the Army Air Corps pilots to practice      shooting. Thinking back, I recall that the small airplane was      so heavy that the WAAF pilot could not get airborne until her      third takeoff attempt on the short grass airfield. Without a      doubt, aeronautical technology has come a long way since that      time.       This military installation has a rich history in the      security of our country. As the Sedalia Army Air Field, it      trained the C-47 pilots to fly the gliders for the Normandy      invasion. Later, as Whiteman Air Force Base, it was the home      of a B-47 wing.       At the height of the Cold War, the base became a Minuteman      I and II missile installation. Knowing that the missile      mission would be phased out eventually, I urged the Air Force      to put a B-1 Bomber Wing at Whiteman in 1982, but a Texas      base was chosen to house the B-1 instead. It was later that      year when I first received a classified briefing on the bat-     winged bomber which was being contemplated by the Air Force.      Subsequently, the legislative battle to authorize and build      the Stealth Bomber was long and arduous, first authorizing 15      bombers, then another 5, then 1 more. During this time, I      quietly urged the Air Force to consider Whiteman Air Force      Base as the first base for this new weapons system.       In early December 1986, Secretary of Defense Casper      Weinberger invited me to his office and told me that he had      decided to place this new airplane at Whiteman Air Force      Base. Since I had worked so hard to make this happen, the      Secretary asked if I would be interested in making the      announcement. At a press conference in Knob Noster on January      5, 1987, I had the honor of announcing that Whiteman Air      Force Base would be the home of the newest and most advanced      bomber in America's fleet, the Stealth Bomber. Then, Major      General, now retired General Jim McCarthy deserves great      credit for helping formulate the decision to put the wing      here.       Shortly after that announcement, the Air Force officially      named the new Stealth Bomber the B-2. And you know the      history from that moment on. Then Brigadier General, later      Lieutenant General Ron Marcotte oversaw the formulation of      the B-2 Wing here at Whiteman.       Since the B-2 has been here for ten years, and people are      fairly accustomed to seeing the aircraft, there might be a      temptation to start considering it as old hat. But let me      take this opportunity to remind you how exceptional this      aircraft is, because you are looking at a significant piece      of aviation history.       First, there was the airplane.       Then, in the First World War, aerial combat.       Then, in the Second World War, radar to see through clouds      and find attackers at great distances.       Then an airplane that disappeared from radar.       The B-2 wasn't the first jet, or the first flying wing, or      the first stealthy airplane, or the first capable of spanning      the globe. But it was the first stealthy jet airplane able to      go anywhere.       The B-2 changed the calculation from the number of planes      per target to the number of targets per plane. It      fundamentally changed the equation of offense versus defense.       It is, in one respect, the summation of the 20th century's      technological advances. It could not stay aloft without      computers. It stays invisible because of advanced materials.      And the airplane and munitions know their precise location      thanks to satellites.       To be sure, the Wright Flyer, wood and canvas, didn't have      much of a radar signature. And it was quiet. And a 12-second      flight is a lot easier than 24 hours.       24 hours. That's the other way the B-2 is the culmination      of its century. The 20th century was, in so many ways, the      American century. It's when our country reached its full      flower, as a nation, as an economic force, as a political      power. There is no more vivid expression of that than this      airplane, which can leave here, project American power      anywhere on the face of the globe, and return without      landing. Winston Churchill called the United States the      world's indispensable nation. The B-2's capabilities make      the aircraft this indispensable nation's most sovereign      instrument.       But before you say, wait a minute, this is an instrument of      war--should we really celebrate it? It's a good question. Let      me answer it this way. This airplane is a humanitarian      advance. Yes, it exists to intimidate, and if necessary to      destroy. But if we accept conflict as inevitable, as history      suggests it is, I ask you--is it better to flatten a city to      hit a single strategic target? That's what we have had to do      through most of my lifetime and that of the airplane--rain      down as many bombs as possible and hope one hits. Or is it      better to save the civilians and just disable the target? If      war is necessary, this airplane lets us separate its effects      from the civilians with whom we have no quarrel.       During the legislative battle to build the B-2, there were      a number of outspoken critics. That criticism continued even      after all 21 planes arrived at Whiteman. But since their      first combat deployments--first during 1999's NATO-led      Operation Allied Force campaign in Yugoslavia, then during      Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and most recently      during Operation Iraqi Freedom--those critics have      disappeared. But it is more than the airplane and JDAM bombs.      It is the men and women here at Whiteman--the maintenance      crews, the bomb handlers, and of course the pilots--who made      this chapter in American military history so very      extraordinary.       When the first B-2 arrived at Whiteman in December 17,      1993, on the 90th anniversary of man's first powered flight      by the Wright Brothers, it was the fulfillment of a dream.      There are any number of reasons why Whiteman Air Force Base      was the logical choice as the home of the B-2, but I believe      the most important reason is the strong support and      patriotism shown by the entire community for generations. And      the Pentagon knows this. I certainly do.       Through the years, people throughout the area--on the      streets, at civic organizations, in the Whiteman Community      Council, in schools, and wherever I go--have given me words      of encouragement about the progress of the B-2 mission at      Whiteman. I doubt if any Member of Congress has ever had such      strong support by the people he represents as I have had in      this historic challenge.       The people of this area have been strong supporters of each      mission assigned here. The Missourians of today are as      steadfast in their support as in yesteryear. Since the day of      the announcement that the B-2 would be located here, the      people of Missouri have taken the B-2, and all those who      support its mission, to their hearts.       With the B-2 mission firmly established at Whiteman, this      base not only has a bright future ahead, but I believe it is      also the premier Air Force Base in the nation. The B-2      mission ensures that Whiteman will continue to be a vital      part of our national security establishment for decades to      come, even though the installation's previous major      mission, the Minuteman Missiles, were removed and silos      destroyed following the end of the Cold War.       And now that the B-2s have undertaken their first combat      deployments--with pinpoint bombing in Kosovo, Afghanistan,      and Iraq--those who fly and maintain this aircraft have more      than proven the usefulness of this weapons system and      demonstrated the foresight of those who imagined the      potential of a long range bomber that could take off from      rural Missouri and fly half-way around the world and back.       So today we Americans have cause to celebrate an American      invention--the airplane and the technologically complex      airplane we call the B-2. As long as there are those skilled      aeronautical engineers whose designs keep American air power      on the cutting edge, and as long as we have dedicated Air      Force men and women who crew and serve these craft, America      will continue to be the bastion of freedom and a secure land.       We know how far the first 100 years of aviation has taken      us. But what will the next 100 years bring? Let me make a few      predictions. In 100 years, planes will fly faster, fly      farther, and probably fly on their own. Whiteman Air Force      Base, which in 100 years will still be the premier Air Force      base in the world, will be home to pilotless, hypersonic,      stealthy bombers, able to reach any point on the globe within      hours. And in 100 years, the people whose hard work and      dedication make these amazing technologies come to life will      be as inspiring to their fellow Americans as their      predecessors amaze and inspire us today.       I'm sure that over the last 10 years quite a few eleven-     year-olds in Lexington, and throughout the state, have looked      toward the sky and caught a glimpse of an airplane--not an      army transport airplane pulling a glider, but the most modern      bomber in the world, the B-2. Like those Army Air Corps      planes of an earlier age, its home is located near Sedalia.      This plane flies for the same purpose as the planes I saw in      1943--to preserve freedom. The airplanes have changed--but      the mission remains the same. "

It is designed to have both air-to-air and air-to-ground fighter capabilities. This aircraft is plagued by cost overruns, technical problems and questions over whether the Air Force should direct its resources to expensive manned aircraft when newer technologies and strategies are more effective and less costly. The bill authorizes $1 billion for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) procurement and research and development. UAV's have the ability to provide first-hand reconnaissance of opposition forces without placing lives at risk. Moreover, UAV's have proven particularly valuable in Afghanistan by identifying and tracking enemy targets, and conducting missions too dangerous for manned aircraft. By canceling the F-22, the Air Force can free up substantial funding that can be used to more aggressively pursue programs such as long range bombers. Yet, we fund this flawed and expensive jet fighter."

e687f8beaca238ad5d1b90e159da662a,2010-09-29,DEFENSE MODERNIZATION,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"The International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military      Balance 2010 report places China third in the number of      artillery systems it fields, after Russia and North Korea.      But China doubtless exceeds both in resource commitment and      breadth of artillery investments. Credited with an estimated      17,700-plus towed, self-propelled and rocket systems, the      People's Liberation Army (PLA) has at least 56 artillery      systems in use, development or available for export. The U.S.      Army and Marine Corps, by contrast, have 8,187-plus artillery      pieces of roughly 10 types.        China has had a mixed record of using artillery for      military and political-military goals. Its successes as when      it routed Indian forces in 1962 with the high-altitude use of      artillery and mortars, have been offset by incidents      provoking third-party responses or leading to regional      standoffs. Examples include the shelling of islands      controlled by Taiwan in 1955-58, resulting in U.S.      intervention and a stalemate over the Taiwan Strait. In July,      a unit based in the Nanjing military region fired missiles      from 300-mm. PHL-03 multiple rocket launchers (MRLs) into the      Yellow Sea to show China's anger at U.S. naval exercises with      South Korea. The exercises, a result of China-backed North      Korea's sinking of the South Korean frigate Cheonon in March,      went ahead anyway.       China evolution as an artillery power stems from Soviet and      Russian influences dating to the Korean War Soviet artillery      and training improved PLA artillery operations during the war      and led to the formation of the first formal artillery      command. Soviet aid continued through the 1950s, and by the      time of the Sin-Soviet split of the 1960s, China was      producing copies or modified versions of Soviet pieces.       The PLA makes extensive use of Soviet-origin 152-, 130- and      122-mm. calibers, though Western calibers such as the 155-      and 105-mm. are seeing greater use. China purchased the      Russian 9A52 Smerch 300-mm. MRL in the 1990s, and the PLA      produced a near facsimile in the A-100/PHL-03 MRL. The 155-     mm. PLZ-05 self-propelled artillery system that emerged in      2005 bears an uncanny resemblance to the Russian 2519 MSTA.       In the 1990s, PLA artillery was affected by reforms in      strategy (its closest concept to doctrine) and organization.      Toward the end of the decade, the PLA was immersed in      strategy goals of ``informatization'' and ``mechanization.''      The former included the broad application of improving      information technologies, which for artillery included new      computer-based fire controls and ever-improving digital      communication and command linkages. PLA artillery units      increasingly include flrefinding counter-battery radar such      as the 50-km.-range (31-mi.) SLC-2 and Type 704, and use      sophisticated electronic warfare systems such as the Russian      SPR-2 radio fuse jammer, a possible Chinese facsimile and      possibly a recently revealed artillery radar jammer.      Artillery recon vehicles and recon troops feature advanced      optronic and digital communication capabilities. In addition,      PLA artillery units have sophisticated meteorological      capabilities and use muzzle velocity radar to improve      accuracy.       Mechanization put renewed emphasis on developing tracked      and wheeled self-propelled tubed artillery, with rocket      artillery largely truck-mounted. This trend was emphasized in      late 2004 when Chinese Communist Party and PLA leader Hu      Jintao enunciated the PLAs new ``historic missions,'' a      euphemism for invasions, which call on the PLA to defend      state interests abroad. It is likely that new medium-weight      artillery systems based on airmobile armored personnel      carriers will follow for these strategic missions.       Organic PLA artillery units have decreased in size,      following the pattern of general large-scale troop      reductions. When combined with ``informatization'' advances,      this will permit many infantry and armored divisions to be      reformed into mechanized brigades. However, in a counter-     trend that emphasizes their continued importance, the PLA      maintains five independent artillery divisions and 20      independent brigades. Of these, two divisions and six      brigades are stationed in the Shenyang and Beijing military      regions, for potential Korean contingencies. Three divisions      and eight brigades are in the Nanjing Guangzhou and Jinan      military regions, for Taiwan contingencies.       Among artillery systems, mortars include a 60-mm. hand-held      system used by infantry and special forces. The new Type 93      60-mm. fixed mortar weighs 22.4 kg. (49.2 lb.) and fires 20      rounds/min. to 5.5 km. There are also fixed W91 and W87 81-     mm. mortars that fire to 8 km. and 5.6 km., respectively. The      PLA has largely copied Russia's Vasilyek 81-mm. automatic      mortar, called the W99 or SM-4, which comes in a towed      version or mounted in a Hummer-like vehicle. It fires four      rounds in 2 sec. out to 6.2 km. The W86 120-mm. towed mortar      weighs 206 kg. and fires 20 rounds/min. to 4.7 km.       In 2001, the PLA revealed the PLL-05 mobile mortar based on      the Russian 120-mm. 2S23 NONA-SVK that it purchased in the      1990s, but mounted on a WZ-551 6 X 6 armored personnel      carrier (APC). It fires a rocket-assisted round 13.5 km. In      2007, the PLA revealed a laser-guided 120-mm. mortar round,      though it is not clear if it is in service.       Towed and self-propelled tubed systems dominate artillery      units. The largest number of towed guns are likely the 122-     mm. versions. These include the Type-96, based on the Russian      D-30, with a 360-deg. traversing base, and the simpler Type-     83. Their rocket-assisted rounds have a 27-km. range. The      Type-59 130-mm. towed gun fires a rocket-assisted round 44      km. Of heavy towed artillery, the 152-mm. Type-66, a copy of      the Russian D-20, is most numerous and fires rocket-assisted      rounds 28 km. In 1999, the PLA revealed the 155-mm. PLL01/WA      021 towed artillery system, based on the Austrian Noricum GH      N-45, which fires a rocket-assisted round 50 km. The PLL01      and the Type-66 fire 155- and 152-mm. versions of the Russian      Krasnopol laser-guided shell.       Self-propelled tubed artillery includes the PLL02, which      places the Type-86 100-mm. gun on a WZ-551 APC. In 2009, the      PLA revealed the new Type-07 122-mm. tracked artillery      system, which features hull and electronic improvements over      the previous Type-89 Tracked 122-mm. system. In 2009,      photographs appeared on the Internet of the SH-3, a truck-     mounted 122-mm. artillery system with digital control systems      in a hatch over the cab.       Heavy self-propelled systems include the 155-mm. PLZ-05,      which has a version of the PLL01 gun, and appeared in 2005.      It is replacing the 152-mm. Type-83, which entered service in      1983. The PLZ-05 also fires the Krasnopol laser-guided      projectile and a rocket-assisted round 50 km., and is capable      of flat-trajectory antitank fire. Unconfirmed reports state      the PLZ-05 has an automatic gun-loading system and weighs 35      tons.       PLA investments in rocket artillery are impressive. A five-     wheel all-terrain vehicle has been modified to carry a 107-     mm. MRL for experimental mechanized special forces units. The      tracked Type-89 and more recent Type-90 truck-mounted 122-mm.      MRL feature self-contained 40-round rocket reloaders. In      addition, the Smerch-derived 12-round PHL-03, which      reportedly fires a 150-km.-range missile, is entering      increasing numbers of artillery units. The latest AR1A export      variant features a modular U.S. MLR system-style 5-round      rocket carrier, which speeds reloading. In 2009, Norinco      revealed an as yet unidentified truck carrier for this 5-     round rocket box, similar to Lockheed Martin's High-Mobility      Artillery Rocket System.       The PLA is also investing in larger MRL systems. The 400-     mm. WS-2D reportedly has a range of 400 km., and one payload      features three ``killer unmanned aerial vehicles,'' according      to a Chinese report. An earlier 200-km.-range version, the      WS-3, uses navigation satellite guidance to achieve a      remarkable 50-meter (164-ft.) circular error probable. The WS      family complements the 150-km.-range P-12 and 250-km. B-611M      maneuverable navsat-guided short-range ballistic missiles      (SRBMs), which could supplement or replace the PLA's two      brigades of 300-600-km. DF-11A SRBMs.       New artillery systems are entering amphibious and airborne      units for possible missions abroad. PLA marine and army      amphibious units are receiving the Type-07B tracked 122-mm.      amphibious artillery system, which places the gun from the      Type-07 on a larger hull. Airborne units are equipped with a      version of the Type-96 122-mm. gun, but a new tracked      airmobile APC may feature a mortar or gun system. The ZBD-09      122-mm. gun system could eventually feature in airmobile army      units. Future artillery systems may feature electromagnetic      launch, an area of extensive research. The PLA is also      interested in ramjet-powered and stealth-coated artillery      shells."

Much of the work that Communication Systems-West performs is of a highly classified nature. However, I can say that the real-time, world-wide dissemination of images and information gathered by the U-2 and our new unmanned aerial vehicles, such as Global Hawk and the Predator, is only possible because of the hard work by the people at Communication Systems-West. For example in 2001, Communication Systems-West was awarded the Collier Award for producing the airborne integrated communications system for the Global Hawk. As my colleagues may know, the Collier Trophy is the National Aeronautic Associations' highest honor for that year's greatest American aeronautical achievement."

7b0b794a5c3eb4dcb1b7b0ad88f564f7,2003-07-21,AVOIDING ENTANGLING ALLIANCES AND INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER NATIONS,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Madam Speaker, the truth about whether or not Saddam Hussein was trying to buy uranium from Niger has dominated the news for the past several weeks. Many of those challenging the administration on this issue are motivated more by politics than by policy. Some doing the challenging were strongly in favor of going to war against Iraq when it appeared politically popular to do so, but are now chagrined that the war is not going as smoothly as was hoped.   I am sure once the alleged attempt to buy uranium is thoroughly debunked, the other excuses for going to war will be examined with a great deal of scrutiny as well. It is obvious that the evidence used to justify going to war is now less than convincing.   The charge that Saddam Hussein had aluminum tubes used in manufacturing nuclear weapons was in error.   A fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles capable of dispensing chemical and biological weapons did not exist.   The 63,000 liters of anthrax and botulism have not been found, nor have any of the mobile germ labs. There are no signs of the 1 million pounds of sarin, mustard and VX gasses.   No evidence has been revealed to indicate Iraq was a threat to anyone's security, let alone ours.   The charge that Saddam Hussein was connected to the al Qaeda was wrong. Saddam Hussein's flaunting of the UN resolutions regarding weapons of mass destruction remains unproven.   How could so many errors have occurred? Some say it was ineptness while others claim outright deception and lies. There are some who say it was selective use of intelligence to promote a particular policy already decided upon. This debate, I am sure, will rage on for a long time, and since motivations are subjective and hard to prove, resolving the controversy will be difficult. However, this should not diminish the importance of sorting out the truth from the fiction, the errors from the malice.   One question, though, I hope gets asked is why should we use intelligence cited by a foreign government as a justification for going to war? One would think that with the billions we spend, we could fully rely on our own intelligence-gathering agencies.   Another point of interest, lacking a coherent foreign policy, we have support for war coming from different groups depending on circumstances unrelated to national defense. For instance, those who strenuously objected to Kosovo promoted war in Iraq. And those who objected to Iraq are now anxious to send troops to Liberia. For some, U.N. permission is important and necessary. For others, the U.N. is helpful as long as it endorses the war they want.   Only a few correctly look to the Constitution and to the Congress to sort out the pros and cons of each conflict and decide whether or not a declaration of war is warranted.   The sad fact is that we have lost our way. A threat to national security is no longer a litmus test for sending troops hither and yon, and the American people no longer require Congress to declare the wars we fight. Hopefully, some day that will be changed.   The raging debate over whether or not Saddam Hussein tried to buy uranium, as important as it is, distracts from the much more important strategic issue of what is the proper foreign policy in a republic.   Hopefully, we will soon seriously consider the policy of noninterventionism in the affairs of others. Avoiding entangling alliances and staying out of the internal affairs of other nations is a policy most conducive to peace and prosperity and one the Founders endorsed. Policing the world and nation building are not part of a constitutional republic."

First and foremost, let me say that I am in      total agreement with your assessment. Simply put, no desired      end state has ever been clearly articulated and no strategy      formulated that would lead us to achieve even an ill defined      end state.       A few points:       1. The strategy of ``clear, hold and build'' would lead one      to believe that the US and its Allies are capable of      coordinating the elements of national power needed to affect      such a strategy. Nothing could be further from the truth.      Just getting DOS and DOD on the same page is difficult enough      . . . getting NGO's and nation building expertise into the      fight is simply a non-starter in a country as dysfunctional      as Afghanistan.       2. Your point about troop strength required to ``protect''      the population and carry out effective counterinsurgency      operations is spot on. Instead of a surge of 21,000 troops,      McChrystal would need a surge of hundreds of thousands. Not      only would our Nation not support such a surge but, MOST      distressing, the Military could not support such a surge. Not      only are our troops being run ragged but, equally important      and totally off most people's radar screens, our equipment is      being run ragged. At some point in time, the bill for that      equipment will come due and it will be a very large bill.       3. Typical of the 21st Century fight, we are fighting ideas      as well as warriors. You cannot defeat ideas with bullets . .      . you must defeat them with better ideas. For many reasons      such as the dysfunction found in the Karzai government, the      tribal nature of the country, the abject poverty of the      average citizen, the inextricable link to Pakistan, we have      been unable to come up with better ideas. We are      systematically destroying the poppy fields . . . the      country's major source of revenue. At the same time, we are      trying to encourage other agricultural efforts. This is one      of our ``better ideas''?? Sad as it is to say, we would do      better to buy the poppy crop ourselves . . . ridding the      world of a source of drugs and maintaining the Afghan      economy.       4. What in Afghanistan is deemed in our Nation's vital      interest? Seriously? Who is the enemy? Seriously? Is the      enemy of the United States the Taliban? Is the enemy al      Queda? We need to determine the answer to those questions      immediately. One would think we would have answered them      already but none of our actions to date would indicate that      we have.       Finally, your recommendation is sound. I would put      ``hunter-killer teams'' along the borders and in suspected al      Queda strongholds. I would support them with intelligence,      logistics thru the use of parasail's, responsive airpower      (need to be close), armed and unarmed (fitted with cameras,      infrared, etc) drones, ``reach back'' capability for cruise      missiles, and other capability as needed. The H-K Teams      should be given minimal rules of engagement . . . when they      identify the bad guys, they need to be empowered to take them      out.       Again, don't be dismayed by the people who disagree with      you. There are many retired and active duty military who feel      you hit the bull's eye.           Semper Fidelis,"

              H. CON. RES. 51, LIBYA WAR POWERS RESOLUTION",Virginia,Foxx,Republican,F,NORTH CAROLINA,580,"On March 21, I reported to the Congress that the United      States, pursuant to a request from the Arab League and      authorization by the United Nations Security Council, had      acted 2 days earlier to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe by      deploying U.S. forces to protect the people of Libya from the      Qaddafi regime. As you know, over these last 2 months, the      U.S. role in this operation to enforce U.N. Security Council      Resolution 1973 has become more limited, yet remains      important. Thus, pursuant to our ongoing consultations, I      wish to express my support for the bipartisan resolution      drafted by Senators Kerry, McCain, Levin, Feinstein, Graham,      and Lieberman, which would confirm that the Congress supports      the U.S. mission in Libya and that both branches are united      in their commitment to supporting the aspirations of the      Libyan people for political reform and self-government.       The initial phase of U.S. military involvement in Libya was      conducted under the command of the United States Africa      Command. By April 4, however, the United States had      transferred responsibility for the military operations in      Libya to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and      the U.S. involvement has assumed a supporting role in the      coalition's efforts. Since April 4, U.S. participation has      consisted of: (1) non-kinetic support to the NATO-led      operation, including intelligence, logistical support, and      search and rescue assistance; (2) aircraft that have assisted      in the suppression and destruction of air defenses in support      of the no-fly zone; and (3) since April 23, precision strikes      by unmanned aerial vehicles against a limited set of clearly      defined targets in support of the NATO-led coalition's      efforts.       While we are no longer in the lead, U.S. support for the      NATO-based coalition remains crucial to assuring the success      of international efforts to protect civilians from the      actions of the Qaddafi regime. I am grateful for the support      you and other Members in Congress have demonstrated for this      mission and for our brave service members, as well as your      strong condemnation of the Qaddafi regime. Congressional      action in support of the mission would underline the U.S.      commitment to this remarkable international effort. Such a      Resolution is also important in the context of our      constitutional framework, as it would demonstrate a unity of      purpose among the political branches on this important      national security matter. It      has always been my view that it is better to take military      action, even in limited actions such as this, with      Congressional engagement, consultation, and support."

The most tangible defense component of our rebalance effort is the realignment of Marines from Okinawa, Japan, to Guam. The bill authorizes nearly $86 million in construction of a U.S. Marine Corps aviation hangar that directly supports the realignment efforts. Most importantly, the bill provides greater exemptions for the use of Government of Japan direct contributions to the realignment. It allows Japanese funds to be used for a $114 million site improvements project at the North Ramp on Andersen Air Force Base. It also allows does not constrain the use of Japanese or U.S. funds for planning and design for realignment projects. We continue to hold the Department of Defense (DoD) accountable for providing Congress with additional cost information about the realignment. The bill authorizes an additional $233 million in other Navy military construction projects on Guam. One such project is the construction of a hangar for the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) MQ-4C platform on Guam.

In a time of constrained budgets we need to look carefully at what platforms will provide the military with the best capabilities. I strongly believe that the Global Hawk Block 30 program provides the U.S. Air Force with a better capability in the long term. Although not addressed in this bill, I support the Appropriations Committee's effort to provide additional funding to the Air Force to investigate the potential to modify the Global Hawk Block 30 aircraft to adapt to certain sensor programs.

Con. Res.      105, a privileged resolution to direct the President to      remove U.S. troops from Iraq within 30 days, or no later than      the end of this year. We urge you to co-sponsor and support      this important resolution.       This resolution, which provides an exception for those      troops needed to protect U.S. diplomatic facilities and      personnel, is likely to be voted on in the full House before      the end of July. The sponsors are using the special      procedures outlined under the War Powers Resolution that      requires the House to take up this bill after 15 calendar      days.       Last month, President Obama announced that 300 personnel      would be sent to Iraq, including intelligence, surveillance      and reconnaissance support, augmented by Apache attack      helicopters and drones, after military aggression by the      Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. A few days later, he      announced another 200 personnel were soon to be deployed.      There are promises to send many additional Hellfire air-to-     surface missiles.       As the United States knows from past, bitter experience in      Vietnam, a small military engagement can escalate into a      major military war that is disastrous for the United States.      There is little a few hundred or a few thousand troops can do      in Iraq that 140,000 could not do at the height of American      involvement in Iraq.       President George W. Bush signed an agreement before leaving      office to withdraw all American forces from Iraq by 2011.      That decision should not be reversed.       Congress has the constitutional responsibility to debate      the merits of American military involvement in Iraq before      the first American casualties. Whatever your position on Iraq      or this resolution, the measure provides an opportunity for      sorely needed debate on a very critical issue.       We urge you to co-sponsor and support the resolution, and      to oppose what is likely to be a tabling motion before the      end of July.

d4979b3489947cea69d94e75ad0a14b8,2014-07-22,TRIBUTE TO DICK CLARK,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Dick Clark was Mandela when Mandela wasn't cool.       A one-term Democratic senator from Iowa and for years      afterward a leader of congressional discussions on apartheid,      Clark is now 85 and long gone from the public scene. But the      ups and downs of his career are an intriguing back story--and      counterpoint--to the outpouring of praise for Nelson Mandela,      the black liberation leader and former president of South      Africa who died Dec. 5.       It wasn't always that way in Washington.       Indeed, Mandela turned 60 in South Africa's Robben Island      prison in the summer of 1978 even as Clark--chairman of the      African Affairs panel on the Senate Foreign Relations      Committee--was fighting for his own re-election in Iowa.       It was a time when Republican challenger Roger Jepsen felt      free to taunt the Democrat as ``the senator from Africa.''      Tensions were such that the State Department called in a      South African Embassy official in May for making disparaging      remarks about Clark in Iowa. And after Clark lost, South      Africa's ousted information secretary, Eschel Rhoodie, said      his government invested $250,000 to defeat Clark, who had      become a thorn in the side of the white regime.       Jepsen denied any knowledge of South Africa's alleged role.      Nor does Clark accuse him of such. But 35 years after, Clark      has no doubt that the apartheid government led by Prime      Minister B. J. Vorster wanted him out--and had a hand in his      defeat.       Clark's liberal record and support of the Panama Canal      Treaty, which narrowly cleared the Senate in the spring of      1978, also hurt his chances in Iowa. But the fatal blow was a      fierce wave of late-breaking ground attacks from anti-     abortion forces--something even conservative writers like      Robert Novak had not anticipated in a published column weeks      before.       ``Abortion was the issue, and how much effect this apparent      $250,000 had to do with promoting it more, I have no way of      evaluating it,'' Clark said in a recent interview at his home      in Washington. ``No question that they did it. They said they      did, and I think they did.''       Clark had made himself a target for South Africa with his      high-profile chairmanship of the Africa subcommittee. In      Washington as well, he was not without critics who accused      him of being too puritanical, too quick to fault U.S. policy.      But like no senator before him, Clark used the panel to raise      the visibility of human rights issues in the southern regions      of the continent.       The roster of prior Africa subcommittee chairs reads like a      Who's Who of national Democrats: John Kennedy in the late      1950s; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, father of the future vice      president; future Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield; and      former Vice President Hubert Humphrey after his return to the      Senate. But all stayed for just one Congress before moving      on. Clark stuck, challenging Cold War policies that he      believed hurt the larger struggle against apartheid that      Mandela symbolized.       ``He was the icebreaker here,'' says his friend Rep. George      Miller (D-Cal.). ``He was out breaking ice on Africa issues      for the country and certainly for the Senate.''       What's more, after losing his Senate seat, Clark didn't      stop. Instead, he found a new classroom via the Aspen      Institute, where the former professor began what amounted to      his own graduate program in 1983 to educate members of      Congress about different policy issues.       Russia had been Clark's early academic interest and was as      well in his first years at Aspen. But Africa tugged and he      set out ``to try to get a cadre of Congress who would know      about South Africa and what was going on in South Africa.''       These typically were nearly weeklong seminars--held at      choice locales overseas to lure members of Congress but also      to provide neutral ground for the warring parties inside      South Africa.       Bermuda, for example, served as a meeting place in 1989.      The island allowed officials from the South African      government to shuttle in and out before the arrival of      outlawed representatives for Mandela's African National      Congress, which was operating then from outside South Africa.       ``All of them were there, making their pitches,'' Clark      said. And once Mandela was released from prison in 1990, the      venue shifted to South Africa itself. ``We got Mandela, who      had just gotten out of jail not long before, to come,'' Clark      recalls of an April 1991 session in Cape Town a seminar that      also included F. W. de Klerk, South Africa's white president.       Most striking here was Clark's impact on Republicans--the      party that helped to throw him out of the Senate.       ``He is a wonder,'' says former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.).      ``I had been told he was a lefty, the stereotype, but he just      drew out people. He never showed bitterness toward the right      or promoting one side.''       Just as ``Mandela made a difference, Dick Clark made a      difference in awareness'' at home in Congress, Simpson adds.       Former Rep. John Porter (R-Ill.) remembers an Aspen meeting      in Cape Town at which Clark surprised the participants on the      last day by sending them out to walk through the      neighborhoods of a black township to meet with families.      ``Dick Clark would do things like that,'' Porter said.       ``This was before all the big changes in South Africa when      we were debating sanctions,'' said former Sen. John Danforth      (R-Mo.). ``He was just so dedicated to it and knew all the      players.''       In fact, Clark says he knew very little about Africa before      coming to the Senate after the 1972 elections. But when a      seat opened up on Foreign Relations in 1975, he grabbed it      and fell into the Africa post just ahead of his classmate      Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), the future vice president.       Timing is everything in Congress and it was Clark's good      fortune in this case. The legendary but very controlling      Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J. William Fulbright (D-     Ark.) had just left the Senate at the end of 1974 and this      allowed subcommittee chairs like Clark to act more on their      own.       ``Fulbright's attitude was the subcommittees couldn't do      anything. Everything ought to be done by the full      committee,'' Clark said. ``I was next to last on seniority.      When it got down to me, the only thing left was Africa about      which I knew very little. Some would say none. So I just      figured: Here's a chance to learn something and I spent a lot      of time doing hearings and learning about Africa.''       He also traveled venturing into southern, sub-Saharan      Africa which was then unfamiliar to many on the Senate      committee.       ``Humphrey told me that he got as far south as Ethiopia,''      Clark said. ``It was new territory and interesting and of      course we were putting a lot of covert money in Africa, as      were the Russians.''       In the summer of 1975, Clark and two aides left Washington      for what was to be a trip to just Tanzania, Zambia and Zaire.      But that itinerary quickly expanded to include the two former      Portuguese colonies, Mozambique and Angola.       The Angola detour was pivotal and included face-to-face      meetings with Central Intelligence Agency personnel on the      ground as well as the leaders of the three rival factions in      Angola's post-colonial civil war. The Soviet Union and Cuba      were then actively backing the new leftist government under      Agostinho Neto. The CIA and South Africa had begun a covert      partnership assisting rebel factions: chiefly Jonas Savimbi      in the south, but also Holden Roberto, whose base was more in      the north and Zaire.       Soon after Clark returned, the debate broke into the open      after news reports detailing the U.S. and South African      operations. Congress cut off new funding in a December 1975      appropriations fight. It then quickly enacted a more      permanent ban the so-called Clark amendment prohibiting      future covert assistance for paramilitary operations in      Angola.       Signed into law in February 1976, the Clark amendment was      repealed under President Ronald Reagan in 1985. Conservatives      long argued that it was always an overreach by Congress,      reacting to Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon's handling of      the Vietnam War.       ``The danger now is the pendulum will swing too far the      other way,'' Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned      Clark's panel in a January 1976 hearing.       But for all the echoes of Vietnam, Clark says he saw his      amendment more as a way to separate the U.S. from South      Africa's apartheid regime.       ``The reason the amendment passed so easily in both houses      was because of Vietnam, so I certainly related the two,''      Clark said. ``But my interest was really in Africa and South      Africa. We were aligning ourselves with apartheid forces. The      reason for my amendment was to disassociate us from apartheid      and from South Africa.''       ``Kissinger had really no feeling for human rights that I      could ever discern and certainly not in South Africa,'' Clark      said. ``His association with South Africa was obviously very      close.''       A year later, visiting South Africa, Clark got a taste of      how closely the white government under Vorster had been      watching him.       That trip included an important meeting in Port Elizabeth      with the young black leader, Steve Biko, who had just been      released from jail and would die 10 months later after a      brutal interrogation in the summer of 1977. Clark said he      became a courier of sorts, taking back a Biko memorandum to      Jimmy Carter's incoming administration.        But while in South Africa, Vorster himself wanted to see      Clark and spent much of an hour quizzing the senator on his      past public comments--even down to small college appearances      in the U.S.       ``He spent an hour with me,'' Clark said. ``They obviously      had followed me to each of these, much to my surprise.''       ``He would quote me. And then he would say, Did you say      that on such and such a date and such and such a place?' ``We      went through this for an hour. He just wanted the opportunity      to tell me how wrong I was about everything I was saying.''       ``He was the last great Afrikaner president,'' Clark said.      ``In fact, he ultimately resigned over the embarrassment of      the Muldergate thing years later.''       The Muldergate thing--as Clark calls it--was a major      scandal inside South Africa in the late 1970s when it was      revealed that government funds had been used by the ruling      National Party to mount a far-reaching propaganda campaign in      defense of apartheid.       This went well beyond placing favorable articles or opinion      pieces in the press. Tens of millions of dollars were      invested to try to undermine independent South African      papers. There was even a failed attempt in the U.S. to buy      the Washington Star in hopes of influencing American policy.       Muldergate got its name from Connie Mulder, South Africa's      information minister at the time. But just as Watergate had      its John Dean, Rhoodie--a top deputy to Mulder--proved the      top witness: a suave propagandist who later gave detailed      interviews and wrote his own book on the subject filling 900-     plus pages.       Rhoodie, who was prosecuted for fraud but cleared by an      appeals court in South Africa, ultimately relocated to the      U.S., where he died in Atlanta in 1993. But by his account,      the Vorster government had used its contacts with a Madison      Avenue public relations firm, Sydney S. Baron  Co. Inc., to      undermine Clark's reelection.       Rhoodie describes a meeting early in 1978 in South Africa      attended by Mulder, Vorster and Baron at which Clark's      election was specifically discussed, and the $250,000 was      later moved into one of Baron's accounts ``to make sure that      Clark was defeated.''       As South Africa's information secretary, Rhoodie was in      fact the signatory of contracts with Baron, according to      filings with the Justice Department. These show the New York      firm initially received about $365,000 annually under a      contract signed in April 1976. This was increased to $650,000      a year later. In August 1977, the same arrangement was      extended through January 1979, including a $250,000 payment      in April 1978.       Whether this $250,000 is a coincidence or what Rhoodie was      speaking on is not clear. At this stage, most of the major      players are dead and New York state corporate records show      Baron's firm was dissolved in 1993--the year that Rhoodie      died.       Watching it all is Clark's friend, old boss in the House      and later Senate colleague, John Culver. The two met in 1964,      when Clark signed on to help Culver win his first House      election and then worked with Culver in Washington until      1972, when Clark went back to Iowa to run for the Senate.       A Harvard-educated Marine Corps veteran, Culver said he had      his own fascination with Africa as a young man in the 1960s.      But he remembered that era as a time of greater optimism, as      new countries across the continent were emerging from      colonial rule.       ``Dick came to it when there was less political reward,''      Culver said. ``But he stuck to it.''"

They said they      did, and I think they did.''       Clark had made himself a target for South Africa with his      high-profile chairmanship of the Africa subcommittee. In      Washington as well, he was not without critics who accused      him of being too puritanical, too quick to fault U.S. policy.      But like no senator before him, Clark used the panel to raise      the visibility of human rights issues in the southern regions      of the continent. The roster of prior Africa subcommittee      chairs reads like a Who's Who of national Democrats: John      Kennedy in the late 1950s; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, father      of the future vice president; future Senate Majority Leader      Mike Mansfield; and former Vice President Hubert Humphrey      after his return to the Senate. But all stayed for just one      Congress before moving on. Clark stuck, challenging Cold War      policies that he believed hurt the larger struggle against      apartheid that Mandela symbolized.       ``He was the icebreaker here,'' says his friend Rep. George      Miller (D-Cal.). ``He was out breaking ice on Africa issues      for the country and certainly for the Senate.'' What's more,      after losing his Senate seat, Clark didn't stop. Instead, he      found a new classroom via the Aspen Institute, where the      former professor began what amounted to his own graduate      program in 1983 to educate members of Congress about      different policy issues.       Russia had been Clark's early academic interest and was as      well in his first years at Aspen. But Africa tugged and he      set out ``to try to get a get a cadre of Congress who would      know about South Africa and what was going on in South      Africa.''       These typically were nearly weeklong seminars--held at      choice locales overseas to lure members of Congress but also      to provide neutral ground for the warring parties inside      South Africa.       Bermuda, for example, served as a meeting place in 1989.      The island allowed officials from the South African      government to shuttle in and out before the arrival of      outlawed representatives for Mandela's African National      Congress, which was operating then from outside South Africa.       ``All of them were there, making their pitches,'' Clark      said. And once Mandela was released from prison in 1990, the      venue shifted to South Africa itself. ``We got Mandela, who      had just gotten out of jail not long before, to come,'' Clark      recalls of an April 1991 session in Cape Town--a seminar that      also included F. W. de Klerk, South Africa's white president.       Most striking here was Clark's impact on Republicans--the      party that helped to throw him out of the Senate.       ``He is a wonder,'' says former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.).      ``I had been told he was a lefty, the stereotype, but he just      drew out people. He never showed bitterness toward the right      or promoting one side.''       Just as ``Mandela made a difference, Dick Clark made a      difference in awareness'' at home in Congress, Simpson adds.       Former Rep. John Porter (R-Ill.) remembers an Aspen meeting      in Cape Town at which Clark surprised the participants on the      last day by sending them out to walk through the      neighborhoods of a black township to meet with families.      ``Dick Clark would do things like that,'' Porter said.       ``This was before all the big changes in South Africa when      we were debating sanctions,'' said former Sen. John Danforth      (R-Mo.). ``He was just so dedicated to it and knew all the      players.'' In fact, Clark says he knew very little about      Africa before coming to the Senate after the 1972 elections.      But when a seat opened up on Foreign Relations in 1975, he      grabbed it and fell into the Africa post--just ahead of his      classmate Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), the future vice      president. Timing is everything in Congress and it was      Clark's good fortune in this case. The legendary but very      controlling Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J. William      Fulbright (D-Ark.) had just left the Senate at the end of      1974 and this allowed subcommittee chairs like Clark to act      more on their own.       ``Fulbright's attitude was the subcommittees couldn't do      anything. Everything ought to be done by the full      committee,'' Clark said. ``I was next to last on seniority.      When it got down to me, the only thing left was Africa about      which I knew very little. Some would say none. So I just      figured: Here's a chance to learn something and I spent a lot      of time doing hearings and learning about Africa.''       He also traveled--venturing into southern, sub-Saharan      Africa which was then unfamiliar to many on the Senate      committee.       ``Humphrey told me that he got as far south as Ethiopia,''      Clark said. ``It was new territory and interesting and of      course we were putting a lot of covert money in Africa, as      were the Russians.'' In the summer of 1975, Clark and two      aides left Washington for what was to be a trip to just      Tanzania, Zambia and Zaire. But that itinerary quickly      expanded to include the two former Portuguese colonies,      Mozambique and Angola.       The Angola detour was pivotal and included face-to-face      meetings with Central Intelligence Agency personnel on the      ground as      well as the leaders of the three rival factions in Angola's      post-colonial civil war. The Soviet Union and Cuba were then      actively backing the new leftist government under Agostinho      Neto. The CIA and South Africa had begun a covert partnership      assisting rebel factions: chiefly Jonas Savimbi in the south,      but also Holden Roberto, whose base was more in the north and      Zaire.       Soon after Clark returned, the debate broke into the open      after news reports detailing the U.S. and South African      operations. Congress cut off new funding in a December 1975      appropriations fight. It then quickly enacted a more      permanent ban--the so-called Clark amendment--prohibiting      future covert assistance for paramilitary operations in      Angola.       Signed into law in February 1976, the Clark amendment was      repealed under President Ronald Reagan in 1985. Conservatives      long argued that it was always an overreach by Congress,      reacting to Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon's handling of      the Vietnam War.       ``The danger now is the pendulum will swing too far the      other way,'' Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned      Clark's panel in a January 1976 hearing. But for all the      echoes of Vietnam, Clark says he saw his amendment more as a      way to separate the U.S. from South Africa's apartheid      regime.       ``The reason the amendment passed so easily in both houses      was because of Vietnam, so I certainly related the two,''      Clark said. ``But my interest was really in Africa and South      Africa. We were aligning ourselves with apartheid forces. The      reason for my amendment was to disassociate us from apartheid      and from South Africa.''       ``Kissinger had really no feeling for human rights that I      could ever discern and certainly not in South Africa,'' Clark      said. ``His association with South Africa was obviously very      close.'' A year later, visiting South Africa, Clark got a      taste of how closely the white government under Vorster had      been watching him.       That trip included an important meeting in Port Elizabeth      with the young black leader, Steve Biko, who had just been      released from jail and would die 10 months later after a      brutal interrogation in the summer of 1977. Clark said he      became a courier of sorts, taking back a Biko memorandum to      Jimmy Carter's incoming administration. But while in South      Africa, Vorster himself wanted to see Clark and spent much of      an hour quizzing the senator on his past public comments--     even down to small college appearances in the U.S. ``He spent      an hour with me,'' Clark said. ``They obviously had followed      me to each of these, much to my surprise.''       ``He would quote me. And then he would say, Did you say      that on such and such a date and such and such a place?' ``We      went through this for an hour. He just wanted the opportunity      to tell me how wrong I was about everything I was saying.''       ``He was the last great Afrikaner president,'' Clark said.      ``In fact, he ultimately resigned over the embarrassment of      the Muldergate thing years later.'' The Muldergate thing--as      Clark calls it--was a major scandal inside South Africa in      the late 1970s when it was revealed that government funds had      been used by the ruling National Party to mount a far-     reaching propaganda campaign in defense of apartheid.       This went well beyond placing favorable articles or opinion      pieces in the press. Tens of millions of dollars were      invested to try to undermine independent South African      papers. There was even a failed attempt in the U.S. to buy      the Washington Star in hopes of influencing American policy.      Muldergate got its name from Connie Mulder, South Africa's      information minister at the time. But just as Watergate had      its John Dean, Rhoodie--a top deputy to Mulder--proved the      top witness: a suave propagandist who later gave detailed      interviews and wrote his own book on the subject filling 900-     plus pages.       Rhoodie, who was prosecuted for fraud but cleared by an      appeals court in South Africa, ultimately relocated to the      U.S., where he died in Atlanta in 1993. But by his account,      the Vorster government had used its contacts with a Madison      Avenue public relations firm, Sydney S. Baron  Co. Inc., to      undermine Clark's reelection.       Rhoodie describes a meeting early in 1978 in South Africa      attended by Mulder, Vorster and Baron at which Clark's      election was specifically discussed, and the $250,000 was      later moved into one of Baron's accounts ``to make sure that      Clark was defeated.'' As South Africa's information      secretary, Rhoodie was in fact the signatory of contracts      with Baron, according to filings with the Justice Department.      These show the New York firm initially received about      $365,000 annually under a contract signed in April 1976. This      was increased to $650,000 a year later. In August 1977, the      same arrangement was extended through January 1979, including      a $250,000 payment in April 1978.       Whether this $250,000 is a coincidence or what Rhoodie was      speaking on is not clear. At this stage, most of the major      players are dead and New York state corporate records show      Baron's firm was dissolved in 1993--the year that Rhoodie      died.       Watching it all is Clark's friend, old boss in the House      and later Senate colleague, John Culver. The two met in 1964,      when Clark signed on to help Culver win his first House      election and then worked with Culver in Washington until      1972, when Clark went back to Iowa to run for the Senate. A      Harvard-educated Marine Corps veteran, Culver said he had his      own fascination with Africa as a young man in the 1960s. But      he remembered that era as a time of greater optimism, as new      countries across the continent were emerging from colonial      rule.       ``Dick came to it when there was less political reward,''      Culver said. ``But he stuck to it.''"

Even though earlier, even during the Bush administration, he came to Capitol Hill and led congressional Muslim staffers here in prayer here on Capitol Hill; even though he had contacts within this administration, he visited with people in this administration's government, for some reason, we didn't see the need to arrest him and put him on trial here in America, but they thought it would be better just to hit him with a drone attack in Yemen and kill him over there."

My point is if this administration felt as if the AUMF, the authorization for use of military force, allowed him to take out an American citizen in Yemen, then how is it that this administration all of a sudden gets scared and says, gee, we might violate the AUMF if we go after the people that killed our Ambassador in an act of war against U.S. property, which was our consulate in Benghazi?"

The AUMF gives the military authority to hunt and kill those responsible for the 2001 attacks, wherever they are, and has allowed President Obama to authorize hundreds of drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Libya. It has also been used to authorize several Special Operations raids, such as the one that took out Osama bin Laden. "

Not only were the warnings there from the August 16 cable that came from the embassy, from Ambassador Stevens, saying that the consulate could not withstand a coordinated attack, but what has been lost in all of this? When we talk about the New York Times trying to erase Al Qaeda from this, the day before, Ayman al-Zawahiri, the head of Al Qaeda, released a video just before September 11, 2012, just before this terrorist attack--which, by the way, occurred on September 11, of course, which should have given us a pretty direct clue that this was a terrorist attack. But al-Zawahiri issued this video acknowledging and eulogizing the death of Abu Yahya al-Libi in a drone strike and calling for terrorist attacks. Al-Libi was a Libyan who served as the second in command in Al Qaeda under Zawahiri and was a top leader in the Libyan Islamic fighting group."

This provision will halt the transfer of the U.S. drone counterterrorism operations from the CIA to the Department of Defense. In doing so, it summarily changes a very important policy that guides how we do certain counterterrorism operations abroad from a direction that the President has specifically prescribed. And how did most of us become aware of this major policy change? By reading this morning's Washington Post; that is how. This is outrageous, and it should not have happened. While there may be differing opinions on who should control drone counterterrorism operations, we should be able to debate these differences in the committees of jurisdiction and eventually on the Senate floor. The fact that a major national security policy decision is going to be authorized in this bill without debate or authorization is unacceptable and should not be the way we legislate on such important national security issues."

But 6 months later, when our armed services were still involved in kinetic actions in Libya--not just supporting our NATO allies but conducting air-to-ground operations and targeted strikes from armed, unmanned aerial vehicles--the administration claimed, as other administrations would, that it had no obligations to Congress under the War Powers Resolution because our Armed Forces were not involved in combat operations.

Robert taught as an associate instructor in the IU Jacobs School of Music Theory Department with the same zeal he approached all his other professional activities. He was in charge of T231 and was loved and admired by his students. As a bass-baritone he had recently appeared as Mr. Gibbs in the world premiere of ``Our Town'' by Ned Rorem, as Marco in the collegiate premiere of William Bolcom's ``A View from the Bridge,'' as well as Joseph and Herod in the collegiate premiere of ``EI Nino'' by John Adams. In September 2005, he conducted the premiere of his own opera, ``Pilatus.'' As a member of the Wolf Trap Opera Company for 2006, he would have added three roles this summer, including Bartolo in ``Le nozze di Figaro,'' Friar Laurence in ``Romeo et Juliette,'' and Pluto in Telemann's ``Orpheus.'' Other opera credits included the title roles of ``Don Pasquale'' and ``Il Turco in Italia,'' as well as Leporello in ``Don Giovanni,'' Falstaff in ``Merry Wives of Windsor,'' and Bottom in ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' In the summer of 2004, Samels performed Creon in the New York premiere of John Eaton's ``Antigone.'' He also frequently performed in the oratorio repertoire. In the spring of 2005, he was selected as a semifinalist in the annual competition of the Oratorio Society of New York. He began his vocal studies with Alfred Anderson at the University of Akron and Andreas Poulimenos at Bowling Green State University. He was a doctoral student in choral conducting at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music and had studied voice with Giorgio Tozzi and Costanza Cuccaro. Robert was an announcer as well as host and producer of ``Cantabile'' with public radio station WFIU.

On September 30, 2011, it was reported that al-Awlaki was killed by the CIA in a drone strike in Yemen. Yet it is being interpreted, as we have heard by some of my colleagues represented here, if the Feinstein amendment were interpreted the way they have interpreted, if al-Awlaki made it to America to commit these terrorist acts, he gets his Miranda rights. He gets all his rights here. But yet if he is in Yemen to do these acts, to try to kill Americans and our allies, then we can use a drone attack to him. But if he makes it to America--which, by the way, the terrorists want to make it to America; 9/11 is Exhibit A of that--why do we want to be in a position to read them their Miranda rights, tell them you have the right to remain silent?

For example, if the Department wanted to deploy a hydrogen-fueled unmanned aerial vehicle that could operate for an extended duration in a combat zone, this amendment would prevent that since the cost of hydrogen fuel may be higher than a traditional fossil fuel. Or if the Department wanted to generate fuel or energy at tactical locations, including waste-to-energy technology, which the DOD is exploring today, section 313 would again prevent that.

                     PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",Betty,McCollum,Democrat,F,MINNESOTA,97,"The Senate and the House are expected to vote this week on      whether to override President Obama's veto of a bill that      would allow families of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks      to sue Saudi Arabia for any role it had in the terrorist      operations. The lawmakers should let the veto stand.       The legislation, called the Justice Against Sponsors of      Terrorism Act, would expand an exception to sovereign      immunity, the legal principle that protects foreign countries      and their diplomats from lawsuits in the American legal      system. While the aim--to give the families their day in      court--is compassionate, the bill complicates the United      States' relationship with Saudi Arabia and could expose the      American government, citizens and corporations to lawsuits      abroad. Moreover, legal experts like Stephen Vladeck of the      University of Texas School of Law and Jack Goldsmith of      Harvard Law School doubt that the legislation would actually      achieve its goal.       Co-sponsored by Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New      York, and Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, the      measure is intended to overcome a series of court rulings      that have blocked all lawsuits filed by the 9/11 families      against the Saudi government. The Senate passed the bill      unanimously in May, and the House gave its approval this      month.       The legislation would, among other things, amend a 1976 law      that grants other countries broad immunity from American      lawsuits--unless the country is on the State Department's      list of state sponsors of terrorism (Iran, Sudan and Syria)      or is alleged to have committed a terrorist attack that      killed Americans on United States soil. The new bill would      clarify that foreign governments can be held liable for      aiding terrorist groups, even if that conduct occurred      overseas.       Advocates say the measure is narrowly drawn, but      administration officials argue that it would apply much more      broadly and result in retaliatory actions by other nations.      The European Union has warned that if the bill becomes law,      other countries could adopt similar legislation defining      their own      exemptions to sovereign immunity. Because no country is more      engaged in the world than the United States--with military      bases, drone operations, intelligence missions and training      programs--the Obama administration fears that Americans could      be subject to legal actions abroad.       The legislation is motivated by a belief among the 9/11      families that Saudi Arabia played a role in the attacks,      because 15 of the 19 hijackers, who were members of Al Qaeda,      were Saudis. But the independent American commission that      investigated the attacks found no evidence that the Saudi      government or senior Saudi officials financed the terrorists.       Proponents of the legislation cite two assassination cases      in which legal claims were allowed against Chile and Taiwan.      Administration officials, however, say that those cases      alleged the direct involvement of foreign government agents      operating in the United States.       The current debate is complicated by the fact that Saudi      Arabia is a difficult ally, at odds with the United States      over the Iran nuclear deal, a Saudi-led war in Yemen and the      war in Syria. It is home of the fundamentalist strand of      Islam known as Wahhabism, which has inspired many of the      extremists the United States is trying to defeat. But it is      also a partner in combating terrorism. The legislation could      damage this fraught relationship. Riyadh has already      threatened to withdraw billions of dollars in American-based      assets to protect them from court action.       The desire to assist the Sept. 11 families is      understandable, and the bill is expected to become law. The      question is, at what cost?"

It also fully funds the President's initiatives in the area of military pay and quality of life programs--such as the largest military pay raise in 15 years, and more than a 50 percent increase in funding for the medical programs supporting our troops and their families. And it includes a new title to deal with counter-terrorism--ranging from more funding for intelligence, to providing additional resources in the area of so-called ``cyber war'' (computer network protection) and improved equipment and research to counter the threats of chemical and biological weapons."

We have the ability, as this administration has shown, to be concerned about an American citizen in Yemen who was radicalized, who was a terrorist, even though he had met with people in this administration, met with people in the prior administration, and had led prayers here on Capitol Hill of Muslim staff members. Wouldn't it have been interesting if this administration had decided to capture him during one of his numerous trips into the United States instead of blowing him up in Yemen? It might have been interesting to find out what he had to say about the people he worked with in this administration and the prior administration on Capitol Hill."

9db81955e87dc6bab82aa2d2fc96cce8,2016-12-09,JASTA,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"The Senate and the House are expected to vote this week on      whether to override President Obama's veto of a bill that      would allow families of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks      to sue Saudi Arabia for any role it had in the terrorist      operations. The lawmakers should let the veto stand.       The legislation, called the Justice Against Sponsors of      Terrorism Act, would expand an exception to sovereign      immunity, the legal principle that protects foreign countries      and their diplomats from lawsuits in the American legal      system. While the aim--to give the families their day in      court--is compassionate, the bill complicates the United      States' relationship with Saudi Arabia and could expose the      American government, citizens and corporations to lawsuits      abroad. Moreover, legal experts like Stephen Vladeck of the      University of Texas School of Law and Jack Goldsmith of      Harvard Law School doubt that the legislation would actually      achieve its goal.       Co-sponsored by Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New      York, and Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, the      measure is intended to overcome a series of court rulings      that have blocked all lawsuits filed by the 9/11 families      against the Saudi government. The Senate passed the bill      unanimously in May, and the House gave its approval this      month.       The legislation would, among other things, amend a 1976 law      that grants other countries broad immunity from American      lawsuits--unless the country is on the State Department's      list of state sponsors of terrorism (Iran, Sudan and Syria)      or is alleged to have committed a terrorist attack that      killed Americans on United States soil. The new bill would      clarify that foreign governments can be held liable for      aiding terrorist groups, even if that conduct occurred      overseas.       Advocates say the measure is narrowly drawn, but      administration officials argue that it would apply much more      broadly and result in retaliatory actions by other nations.      The European Union has warned that      if the bill becomes law, other countries could adopt similar      legislation defining their own exemptions to sovereign      immunity. Because no country is more engaged in the world      than the United States--with military bases, drone      operations, intelligence missions and training programs--the      Obama administration fears that Americans could be subject to      legal actions abroad.       The legislation is motivated by a belief among the 9/11      families that Saudi Arabia played a role in the attacks,      because 15 of the 19 hijackers, who were members of Al Qaeda,      were Saudis. But the independent American commission that      investigated the attacks found no evidence that the Saudi      government or senior Saudi officials financed the terrorists.       Proponents of the legislation cite two assassination cases      in which legal claims were allowed against Chile and Taiwan.      Administration officials, however, say that those cases      alleged the direct involvement of foreign government agents      operating in the United States.       The current debate is complicated by the fact that Saudi      Arabia is a difficult ally, at odds with the United States      over the Iran nuclear deal, a Saudi-led war in Yemen and the      war in Syria. It is home of the fundamentalist strand of      Islam known as Wahhabism, which has inspired many of the      extremists the United States is trying to defeat. But it is      also a partner in combating terrorism. The legislation could      damage this fraught relationship. Riyadh has already      threatened to withdraw billions of dollars in American-based      assets to protect them from court action.       The desire to assist the Sept. 11 families is      understandable, and the bill is expected to become law. The      question is, at what cost?"

In fiscal year 2017, Senator Reid      worked to obtain over $204 million in federal funding for      projects at the Nellis Air Force Base, Naval Air Station      Fallon, and Reno VA Medical Center. In addition, $90 million      was allocated nationwide for construction of state veteran      extended care facilities, including one to eventually be      built in Reno.       Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC)--     Successfully fought to keep Hawthorne Army Depot open through      the BRAC process and prevented the Nevada Air National Guard      from losing their C-130 aircraft.

The following year, Senator Reid won passage of his      amendment that expanded concurrent receipt to cover America's      disabled veterans rated as unemployable. This issue has been      a top priority of Nevada's 250,000 veterans, as well as      veterans across the country.       New Las Vegas Veteran's Hospital--Senator Reid has secured      more than $600 million for the construction of the Veterans      Administration's new Las Vegas Hospital and Community Living      Center on Pecos Road in North Las Vegas.

0bceaf1d9b887eecbd76a4ef2c1b246a,2000-07-14,UNMANNED COMBAT VEHICLE INITIATIVE,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Today's technology gives us the ability to do things in      different ways. All we really need is determination. In      preparing for future conflicts, the area of unmanned systems      is one where institutional determination has not matched      technological reach. But that may be about to change.       Sen. John Warner, R-Va, chairman of the Armed Services      Committee, recently announced that he supports efforts to      make one-third of the U.S. operational deep strike aircraft      unmanned by 2010, and one-third of ground vehicles unmanned      by 2015.       Such a significant change in how the United States conducts      military operations would have a profound impact on future      national security efforts. Having spent many years of my      career in the defense industry working on unmanned systems, I      believe Warner's goals are reasonable aspirations. In my      view, such an acceleration reflects both a technological      possibility and an operational necessity. Certainly, there      are technological challenges to be overcome, but the greatest      obstacle may be our past experiences and concepts.       A senior defense official commented last year that, by the      year 2050, there will be no manned aircraft in the military      inventory. A growing number of senior officers see this      transition as inevitable. However, most do not see it as      imminent. The 50-year period suggested in that observation      approximates the chronological distance separating Kitty Hawk      from Sputnik.       Although there are certainly issues to be resolved,      particularly regarding command and control, we know      considerably more today about building and controlling      unmanned vehicles than the Wright Brothers did about      rocketry.       Certainly, there are those who harbor reservations about      unmanned systems. But I have been surprised at the growing      acceptance of these technologies across the Defense      Department. Field commanders, in particular, increasingly are      confident and comfortable about conducting unmanned strikes.      During Operation Desert Fox--the fourth-day campaign against      Iraq in December 1998--72 percent of the strikes were      conducted by unmanned cruise missiles. By comparison, during      the first four days of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, only 6      percent of the strikes were conducted with cruise missiles.       Although the scales of these two operations were      significantly different, this dramatic shift to unmanned      strike systems reflects a fundamental operational change.       As Gen. Michael Ryan, Air Force chief of staff, has      commented on several occasions, cruise missiles and other      standoff munitions are merely unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)      on a ``one-way trip.'' Transitioning to UAVs that are re-     usable and capable of making numerous trips dropping less      costly precision munitions is within our near-term      technological ability.       Calculations suggest that in fewer than 10 missions,      unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) dropping ordnance      similar to Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) become      considerably more cost-effective than cruise missiles.      Furthermore, these calculations do not consider additional      cost savings resulting from lower manning and routine      operational costs.       In the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR)      mission area, UAVs already are well accepted. The recent      testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee by Gens.      Wesley Clark and Anthony Zinni, commanders-in-chief of two of      our more important regional commands, reflects this trend.      Both articulated the need for a larger number of UAVs for ISR      missions that ``are 24-hour-a-day capable and are adverse-     weather capable.''       In my view, this is a near-term possibility. Assets such as      the Global Hawk system provide such a capability. When teamed      with other key ISR assets, such as the joint surveillance      target attack radar system (JSTARS) and the airborne warning      and control system (AWACS), U.S. commanders will have a      formidable capability for seeing their operational area in      real-time, in all weather. Other assets--such as the Predator      UAV, the Army's new tactical UAV, and the Navy's vertical      take-off UAV--will offer high-fidelity battlefield      surveillance to tactical commanders."

831f3abd350f301dfaee5c95042ff614,2005-02-09,BRUNSWICK NAVAL AIR STATION'S STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"In the business of homeland defense (as in real estate),      location is the key. Imagine a naval search for a single,      relatively small merchant ship, which intelligence sources      have revealed has a hold full of weaponized chemicals. Its      destination is a major coastal city. After tense hours of      searching, a maritime patrol aircraft locates two possible      suspect vessels out of hundreds in one of the world's busiest      maritime areas. The aircraft directs two fast naval frigates      to the vicinity of the targets. The frigates and their      onboard helicopters intercept and challenge the target      vessels. One vessel submits to search and is determined to be      harmless. The other however, resists interception and      boarding. Finally, helicopter-borne special operations      commandoes descend upon the vessel, board and secure the ship      and its potentially deadly cargo.       This scenario actually occurred in the western      Mediterranean Sea last month. The weapons of mass destruction      seized were simulated; the entire sequence of events part of      a successful exercise of Maritime Interdiction Operations      conducted by forces of four NATO nations.       Maritime interdiction capability is a hot item right now      for defense planners, a particularly important focus of a      larger effort known as the Proliferation Security Initiative      (PSI). PSI is being advanced by 15 core member nations,      brought together at the request of President Bush last year      to develop cooperative diplomatic, military, and intelligence      means to stop ships which may be carrying weapons of mass      destruction (WMD). Many of the maritime interdiction precepts      under PSI are evolving from a multinational ``game''      conducted last September at the Naval War College in Newport,      Rhode Island, and refining these concepts and procedures is      clearly a high priority for the nations involved. Japan      recently hosted the latest multinational PSI exercise, the      twelfth in the short time since the Initiative began.       As the Mediterranean exercise and others showed, Maritime      Patrol Aircraft (MPA) are a critical, almost always essential      part of successful maritime interdiction. Whether conducting      a broad-area search, refining a datum provided by other      (including national) sensors, or vectoring surface, rotary-     wing or      special-warfare assets to a target, MPA are a key link in the      chain from initial intelligence to intercept. MPA are of      particular value in crowded shipping lanes, in areas of poor      weather or visibility. No other platform is as versatile in      this mission area, one as old and enduring as naval aviation      itself. But land-based aircraft need bases to fly from--bases      which optimize their speed, range, and turnaround capability      on missions protecting the nation's most vital areas. The      seaborne WMD threat has become primary. Maritime interdiction      platforms and infrastructure must be top concerns for naval      strategists and planners.       Fortunately help is on the way, again from patrol aviation.      The Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) promises a      substantial increase in capability for commanders responsible      for maritime interdiction. Based on the Boeing 737-800, the      MMA will bring increased speed, range, and reliability      compared to the current workhorse MPA, the P-3C Orion. MMA      sensors for interdiction missions will include a new electro-     optical and infrared spectrum sensor, moving target      indicators, an enhanced inverse synthetic aperture /      synthetic aperture radar, and a new signals intelligence      suite. Perhaps best of all, MMA will control and exploit the      capabilities of the Broad-Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS)      Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.       The aircraft themselves will certainly be fantastic, but      land-based planes are only as good as the base they operate      from, and the future homes for MMA/BAMS have not yet been      identified. Conventional wisdom has it that the transition      from the P-3 force to one of fewer than half as many MMA will      inevitably result in a reduction in the number of maritime      patrol aircraft bases in the U.S. This assumption may be      incorrect, since optimum basing for maritime interdiction      assets is as important as the assets themselves. Bases must      be located to provide rapid response to all coastal areas,      particularly those containing major population centers and      port facilities. They must be versatile, able to support not      just MPA, but rotary wing units and special warfare forces      with easy access, unencumbered space and facilities for      joint, coordinated training, and self-protection and security      from intrusion or attack. Maritime interdiction is a team      game, and collocation of the assets for training and      operations is essential.       The current MPA force laydown includes P-3 bases at Kaneohe      Bay in Hawaii, Jacksonville, Florida, Brunswick, Maine, and      Whidbey Island in Washington State. A robust P-3 capability      is maintained for fleet support and other missions at the      North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego. These last four      bases, at the ``corners'' of the continental U.S. are      perfectly situated for maritime interdiction of WMD threats.      From these sites, MMA response time to any point on the coast      will be less than two hours, and all major sea lanes of      approach can be covered within the 1200--1500 nautical mile      operational range of the aircraft.       All four sites have their advantages, and all are essential      to that coverage. For example, the Naval Air Station in      Brunswick, Maine has remarkable potential as a joint forces      maritime interdiction center under the PSI initiative: The      only remaining fully capable active-duty military airfield in      the northeastern U.S. and near its coastal cities--a region      of over 48 million people; immediately adjacent to all major      sea lanes in the North Atlantic; more than 63,000 square      miles of unencumbered airspace for training and exercise      missions; versatile and extensive modern facilities      (including a new hangar designed specifically for MMA and      BAMS) and land with no encroachment issues; an established      all-weather training area available for Special Forces and      other units; completely secured perimeter and outstanding      force protection layout and capability; and easy access by      all forms of transportation.       The ports and shipping lanes to the northeastern region of      the United States deserve the protection which can only be      provided by maritime interdiction forces operating from a      base within that region. Obviously transatlantic shipping is      critical to our nation's economy, but as west coast ports      operate at capacity, more and more operators are redirecting      their shipments from Asia directly to the northeast. These      shippers prefer to have their cargo spend the additional 7 to      10 days at sea rather than accept delays at west coast ports      and during rail transport across the continent. Container      traffic to New York alone has risen 65% in the last five      years, the fastest rate of growth in over 50 years. All of      the enormous volume of shipping to the region must be      monitored, and if necessary interdicted whenever it may pose      a threat.       The Defense Department's Base Closure and Realignment      Commission (BRAC) will in 2005 identify military      infrastructure for permanent elimination. The BRAC process      must carefully factor in future requirements for maritime      interdiction as they are just now being developed under the      PSI. Caution is indicated--the nation cannot afford to close      irreplaceable military facilities just as new concepts and      capabilities are being developed to address a burgeoning      threat. Maritime interdiction of weapons of mass destruction      headed for our shores is zero-defect work, and the selection      of bases for that effort must be equally judicious and      effective. Location is an enduring essential--we must keep      open our bases ``at the corners.''"

While Senators may disagree with the administration's policies regarding the use of drones for lethal counterterrorism operations--and I have raised concerns about some of those operations--it is important not to conflate the confirmation of David Barron with the disclosure of Justice Department memoranda over which he had no control. He wrote an analysis of the law. Others make the decision of what they will do."
3bc40041108fcc6efe1a48fce3af54b1,2014-05-22,JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Dear Senators Reid, McConnell, Leahy, and Grassley: I do      not often interject myself into the politics of judicial      confirmations, but in the case of David Barron I make an      exception. In my opinion, David Barron is one of President      Obama's two or three best nominations to the appellate      courts. Based on his scholarship and record of public      service, he has the potential to be one of this nation's      outstanding jurists.       It should be obvious that my assessment does not stem from      political agreement. Barron has described himself as an      advocate of ``progressive constitutionalism''; I believe the      Constitution should be interpreted without a partisan lens,      in terms of the principles reflected in its text and history.      I suspect that on particular controversial issues, Barron and      I disagree more often than not. But I have read much of his      academic work, and followed his performance as acting head of      the Office of Legal Counsel. In my opinion, his writings and      opinions have demonstrated not only intelligence (even where      we disagree) but respect for the rule of law. In the Office      of Legal Counsel, whose functions closely resemble those of a      judge, Barron's publicly released opinions indicated that he      was consistently a force for legal regularity and respect for      the constitution and laws of the United States. That is an      important and precious thing.       Some groups have been described Barron as ``an unabashed      proponent of judicial activism.'' That characterization,      frankly, demonstrates a lack of familiarity with the tone of      much academic debate over constitutional issues. Within that      framework, Barron stands out as an advocate of lawyerly      restraint. It is important to bear in mind that academic      legal writing in constitutional law is often exploratory and      provocative. No one should assume that an academic would take      the same approach toward deciding cases that he does in      writing about cases.       In ordinary times, Barron's legal ability and professional      integrity would suffice to ensure his confirmation. But      unfortunately, in recent decades, and especially during      President George W. Bush's presidency, the opposition party      has taken a more ideological and adversarial posture toward      judicial nominations than the framers of our Constitution      intended. It is understandable that Republicans today would      apply the same adversarial standards to President Obama's      nominations as the Democrats applied to exemplary nominees of      his predecessor. It is my hope that eventually, this process      of mutually assured destruction will pass, for nominees of      both parties. That cannot be expected to occur without mutual      accommodation and confidence that the same standards apply to      nominees from both sides.       Nonetheless, David Barron's nomination should be supported      by Senators of both parties. Perhaps the most significant      constitutional questions of our time arise from the      unilateral use of executive power in both the domestic and      international arenas. David Barron has written powerfully on      this subject, demonstrating a balance between the need for an      energetic executive and the centrality of law and the      legislative branch. He has supported efforts to adopt laws to      enable judicial review of executive actions that might      otherwise escape judicial review because of lack of standing,      and has written powerfully about the need for constitutional      limits on executive excesses.       Some may wonder whether Barron's defense of separation of      powers against executive unilateralism, which he articulated      in the context of the Bush presidency, will survive intact in      a presidency he supports. That is a legitimate question. No      one knows the answer. But speaking as a fellow legal academic      and sometime nominee, I believe that David Barron is a      straight shooter and will not trim the sails of his deep-felt      constitutional convictions on account of the different      direction of political winds. One of this nation's proudest      claims is that the limitations of constitutionalism hold firm      without regard to which party is in power. I believe David      Barron will carry on that tradition.       Beyond generalizations about judicial philosophy, this      nomination has encountered resistance because of Barron's      authorship of opinions in the Office of Legal Counsel      justifying drone attacks by American forces on specified      individuals abroad. The Administration's public legal defense      of these strikes, especially by Attorney General Eric Holder,      have been less than convincing as a legal matter. It is      important for Congress to consider the legality of these      strikes, but I strongly urge that Barron's nomination to the      First Circuit not be collateral damage to this debate.       The pertinent question for this nomination cannot be      whether any Senator agrees or disagrees with the practice of      drone strikes. Barron was not Commander in Chief and he did      not order the strikes. He has not been nominated to a      position with authority over drone strikes, so his view of      those strikes is relevant only to the more general question      of his suitability to be an appellate judge on a court of      broad jurisdiction. His job as acting head of the Office of      Legal Counsel was to advise the President based on the      traditional legal authorities of text, history, and      precedent. He must be evaluated in light of that role.       Of course, neither I nor anyone else can evaluate the legal      arguments made in Barron's OLC opinions until they are      released. But whatever their content, it is difficult to      imagine that they would place Barron outside the mainstream      of professional legal judgment. The question of drone strikes      is novel and much debated, and the authoritative legal      sources are scant. It is far from clear that the Due Process      Clause even applies to military attacks on targets in places      abroad where American law does not run. If it does, it is      equally unclear what kind of process is required when split-     second decisions are made that could save countless innocent      lives. These are discussions that should occur in the proper      place, but a judicial nomination is not the forum for their      resolution.       Ultimately, this confirmation requires a judgment about      judicial character. The most important characteristic of a      great judge is not brainpower or empathy, but the willingness      to apply rules of law dispassionately and unflinchingly to      all cases, regardless of the political context. My sense from      long conversations with David Barron, and review of his      writings and legal opinions, is that he is such a person. I      urge members of the Senate to give their advice and consent.           Best regards,                                             Michael W. McConnell."

It said that OLC ``operates from the presumption that it should make its significant opinions fully and promptly available to the public. This presumption furthers the interests of Executive Branch transparency, thereby contributing to accountability and effective government, and promoting public confidence in the legality of government action.'' This presumption did not exist in the Bush administration; David Barron was responsible for establishing it as OLC policy. Given Barron's impressive record and his shift of OLC toward more transparency, it simply is wrong to oppose his nomination because a classified OLC opinion on drone strikes has not been made public yet, a decision that was not even his to make."

While the country has made mistakes in the past, the      widespread abuse of human rights over the last decade has      been a dramatic change from the past. With leadership from      the United States, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights      was adopted in 1948 as ``the foundation of freedom, justice      and peace in the world.'' This was a bold and clear      commitment that power would no longer serve as a cover to      oppress or injure people, and it established equal rights of      all people to life, liberty, security of person, equal      protection of the law and freedom from torture, arbitrary      detention or forced exile. The declaration has been invoked      by human rights activists and the international community to      replace most of the world's dictatorships with democracies      and to promote the rule of law in domestic and global      affairs. It is disturbing that, instead of strengthening      these principles, our government's counterterrorism policies      are now clearly violating at least 10 of the declaration's 30      articles, including the prohibition against ``cruel, inhuman      or degrading treatment or punishment.''       Recent legislation has made legal the president's right to      detain a person indefinitely on suspicion of affiliation with      terrorist organizations or ``associated forces,'' a broad,      vague power that can be abused without meaningful oversight      from the courts or Congress (the law is currently being      blocked by a federal judge). This law violates the right to      freedom of expression and to be presumed innocent until      proved guilty, two other rights enshrined in the declaration.       In addition to American citizens' being targeted for      assassination or indefinite detention, recent laws have      canceled the restraints in the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act of 1978 to allow unprecedented violations of      our rights to privacy through warrantless wiretapping and      government mining of our electronic communications. Popular      state laws permit detaining individuals because of their      appearance, where they worship or with whom they associate.       Despite an arbitrary rule that any man killed by drones is      declared an enemy terrorist, the death of nearby innocent      women and children is accepted as inevitable. After more than      30 airstrikes on civilian homes this year in Afghanistan,      President Hamid Karzai has demanded that such attacks end,      but the practice continues in areas of Pakistan, Somalia and      Yemen that are not in any war zone. We don't know how many      hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed in these      attacks, each one approved by the highest authorities in      Washington. This would have been unthinkable in previous      times.       These policies clearly affect American foreign policy. Top      intelligence and military officials, as well as rights      defenders in targeted areas, affirm that the great escalation      in drone attacks has turned aggrieved families toward      terrorist organizations, aroused civilian populations against      us and permitted repressive governments to cite such actions      to justify their own despotic behavior.       Meanwhile, the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,      now houses 169 prisoners. About half have been cleared for      release, yet have little prospect of ever obtaining their      freedom. American authorities have revealed that, in order to      obtain confessions, some of the few being tried (only in      military courts) have been tortured by waterboarding more      than 100 times or intimidated with semiautomatic weapons,      power drills or threats to sexually assault their mothers.      Astoundingly, these facts cannot be used as a defense by the      accused, because the government claims they occurred under      the cover of ``national security.'' Most of the other      prisoners have no prospect of ever being charged or tried      either.       At a time when popular revolutions are sweeping the globe,      the United States should be strengthening, not weakening,      basic rules of law and principles of justice enumerated in      the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But instead of      making the world safer, America's violation of international      human rights abets our enemies and alienates our friends.       As concerned citizens, we must persuade Washington to      reverse course and regain moral leadership according to      international human rights norms that we had officially      adopted as our own and cherished throughout the years.       Jimmy Carter, the 39th president, is the founder of the      Carter Center and the recipient of the 2002 Nobel Peace      Prize."

I believe this assertion will strike most of my colleagues and the Americans they represent as a confusing breach of common sense, and it seems to be undercut by the very report the administration sent to Congress which makes clear that U.S. Armed Forces have been and presumably will continue to fly limited strike missions to suppress enemy air defenses, to operate armed Predator drones that are attacking Qadhafi's forces in an effort to protect Libyan civilians, and to provide the overwhelming support for NATO operations, from intelligence to aerial refueling. Indeed, we read in today's New York Times that since the April 7 date that the administration claims to have ceased hostilities in Libya, U.S. warplanes have struck at Libyan air defenses on 60 occasions and fired about 30 missiles from unmanned drones."
24af413a890050e3c07030a594650946,2011-06-21,LIBYA,John,McCain,Republican,M,ARIZONA,2023,"Washington.--Since the United States handed control of the      air war in Libya to NATO in early April, American warplanes      have struck at Libyan air defenses about 60 times, and      remotely operated drones have fired missiles at Libyan forces      about 30 times, according to military officials.       The most recent strike from a piloted United States      aircraft was on Saturday, and the most recent strike from an      American drone was on Wednesday, the officials said.       While the Obama administration has regularly acknowledged      that American forces have continued to take part in some of      the strike sorties, few details about their scope and      frequency have been made public.       The unclassified portion of material about Libya that the      White House sent to Congress last week, for example, said      ``American strikes are limited to the suppression of enemy      air defense and occasional strikes by unmanned Predator''      drones, but included no numbers for such strikes.       The disclosure of such details could add texture to an      unfolding debate about the merits of the Obama      administration's legal argument that it does not need      Congressional authorization to continue the mission because      United States forces are not engaged in ``hostilities''      within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution.       Under that 1973 law, presidents must end unauthorized      deployments 60 days after notifying Congress that they have      introduced American forces into actual or imminent      hostilities. That deadline for the Libyan mission appeared to      pass on May 20, but the administration contended that the      deadline did not apply because the United States' role had      not risen to the level of ``hostilities,'' at least since it      handed control of the mission over to NATO.       In support of that argument, the administration has pointed      to a series of factors, noting, for example, that most of the      strikes have been carried out by allies, while the United      States has primarily been playing ``non-kinetic'' supporting      roles like refueling and surveillance. It has also said there      is little risk of American casualties because there are no      ground troops and Libyan forces have little ability to      exchange fire with American aircraft. And it noted that the      mission is constrained from escalating by a United Nations      Security Council resolution.       The special anti-radar missiles used to suppress enemy air      defenses are usually carried by piloted aircraft, not drones,      and the Pentagon has regularly said that American military      aircraft have continued to conduct these missions. Still,      officials have been reluctant to release the exact numbers of      strikes.       Under military doctrine, strikes aimed at suppressing air      defenses are typically considered to be defensive actions,      not offensive. On the other hand, military doctrine also      considers the turning on of air-defense radar in a no-fly      zone to be a ``hostile act.'' It is not clear whether any of      the Libyan defenses were made targets because they had turned      on such radar.       The administration's legal position prompted internal      controversy. Top lawyers at the Justice Department and the      Pentagon argued that the United States' military activities      did amount to ``hostilities'' under the War Powers      Resolution, but President Obama sided with top lawyers at the      State Department and the White House who contended that they      did not cross that threshold.       On Monday, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary,      acknowledged the internal debate, but defended the judgment      made by Mr. Obama, noting that the applicability of the War      Powers Resolution to deployments has repeatedly prompted      debate over the years.       The House of Representatives may vote later this week on a      proposal to cut off funding for the Libya mission. The      proposal is backed by an odd-bedfellows coalition of antiwar      liberals and Tea Party Republicans.       They are opposed by an equally unusual alignment of      Democrats who support the White House and the intervention in      Libya, and more hawkish Republicans.       On Monday, a group that includes prominent neoconservative      figures--including Liz Cheney, Robert Kagan, William Kristol      and Paul Wolfowitz--sent Republicans an open letter opposing      efforts to cut off funds for the mission."

In several ways, they are at odds with the      strategy adopted by NATO, which aims to turn over the war to      the Afghan army by the end of 2014. For that plan to succeed,      military commanders believe that U.S. and allied forces must      hold the areas in southern Afghanistan that have been cleared      of the Taliban through this summer's fighting season as well      as that of 2012. They also must sweep eastern provinces that      have not yet been reached by the counterinsurgency campaign.       By withdrawing 5,000 U.S. troops this summer and another      5,000 by the end of the year, Mr. Obama will make those tasks      harder. By setting September 2012 as a deadline for      withdrawing all of the 33,000 reinforcements he ordered in      late 2009, the President risks undermining not only the war      on the ground but also the effort to draw elements of the      Taliban into a political settlement; the militants may prefer      to wait out a retreating enemy. It also may be harder to gain      cooperation from Pakistan, whose willingness to break with      the Taliban is linked to its perception of U.S. determination      to remain engaged in the region. U.S. allies, which have      committed 40,000 troops to the 2014 plan, may revise their      own exit strategies.       An accelerated withdrawal of American forces would make      more sense if Mr. Obama had decided to abandon the modified      counterinsurgency plan he adopted at the end of 2009, which      was later expanded and endorsed by NATO. Vice President      Biden, among others, has pressed for a more limited      counterterrorism strategy focused on combating al-Qaeda. But      Mr. Obama offered no indication in Wednesday's speech that he      has altered his objectives. Instead, he argued that the      reduction is possible because ``we are achieving our goals. .      . . We are starting this drawdown from a position of      strength.''       Mr. Obama correctly pointed out that the killing of Osama      bin Laden and operations in Pakistan have weakened al-Qaeda      and limited its ability to attack the United States. But a      Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan, which Mr. Obama's      withdrawals risk, would be deeply destabilizing for a region      that includes nuclear-armed Pakistan and India. If the Afghan      government or army crumbles, there would be a considerable      chance that the United States would lose the bases it now      uses for drone attacks against al-Qaeda.       Perhaps the best justification for Mr. Obama's decision is      U.S. domestic opinion. As senior administration officials      have pointed out, Americans have grown weary of the war;      polls show that a majority support a rapid withdrawal of U.S.      forces, and that view is increasingly reflected in Congress      and even among Republican presidential candidates. Many in      Congress cite the cost of the war--though the few billion      dollars saved through a faster withdrawal will have little      impact on a deficit measured in trillions.       By announcing these pullouts, Mr. Obama may ease some of      the political pressure while still allowing his commanders      enough forces to complete the 2014 transition plan. The      president's supporters point out that at the end of 2012,      there will still be twice as many U.S. troops in      Afghanistan--68,000--as when Mr. Obama took office. We hope      those prove sufficient. But Mr. Obama's withdrawal decision,      with no clear basis in strategy, increases the risk of      failure."

Mr. Matlock also redirected the agency's modeling and simulation approach by using state of the art open architecture frameworks that allowed plug and play capability of a disparate set of models from a diverse contractor base thus eliminating intellectual property loss and reducing the time required for model code rewrite."

9742493b0317ff73220f78654b318b89,2008-07-10,OP-ED SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF CARIBBEAN NATIONS,Charles,Rangel,Democrat,M,NEW YORK,177,"It was befitting to hold the meeting bringing together the      Caribbean community in New York and the Caribbean heads of      state at York College, City University of New York, where the      President of that institution, Marcia Keizs and the Provost      and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs have roots in      the Caribbean and a majority of the 6,000 student body are      either first or second generation Caribbean.       As one of the Caribbean heads of state remarked, he had to      travel to New York to address an audience of Caribbean people      as the movement of Caribbean people within the region remains      limited with the exception of the students in higher      education moving among the Mona, Cave Hill and St. Augustine      campuses of the University of the West Indies. The Friday      evening meeting on June 20, 2008 was designed to facilitate      an intellectual exchange between leaders and non-leaders      about the Diaspora and the future of, CARICOM.       The Diaspora community already plays a critical role in the      form of remittances. Billions of dollars are sent to the      respective islands to help out family members, to expand      existing homes, to start businesses, and to provide some of      the basic necessities of life. In many islands remittances      have been instrumental in reducing the percentage of people      living in poverty.       The format of the exchange enabled designated heads of      state to address the audience and to allow the audience to      ask questions or to make comments. This kind of mass      questioning tends to attract to the open microphones speakers      who are long-winded and with wide ranging concerns that      invariably brings a certain incoherence to the discourse.       The world economy has changed dramatically since the      initiation of CARICOM. In 2008, CARICOM is to make further      strides in the development of a single market economy. Even      within the units of CARICOM, there are no economies of scale.      There are opportunities for investment and for the pooling of      resources. The economist, Dr. Norman Girvan, has produced a      paper outlining the future for further economic expansion.      Trinidad and Tobago has emerged as the economic giant in the      region and is standing even taller as the price of oil soars      towards one hundred and fifty dollars per barrel. T and T is      overflowing with investment capital at the same time      nonexporting oil countries in the region are reeling from the      rapid rise in oil and food prices that are now the norm in      the world economy.       CARICOM at the beginning of the year signed a trade      agreement with the European Union that opens those economies      to Caribbean products and European products to the Caribbean      region. CARICOM and CARIFORUM can no longer look inwards. It      must look outwards either as a region or as independent      islands. There is the dire urgency to put together an export      oriented strategy to compete in the global economy of the      21st century.       The crime calamity in the Caribbean basin is indeed an      outgrowth of the economic crisis and even though some sorely      needed initiatives will be able to strengthen the shaky      social order, long term stability will depend on the      strengthening of the export sector in relationship to the      world economy.       The Caribbean entered the world economy as an exporter of      sugar with African slave labor. By the beginning of the 19th      century, sugar production in the old English colonies had      peaked and was unable to match the yield per acre of the new      sugar-cane fields in Cuba. In the post-emancipation years and      post-colonial interlude, the economies of the Caribbean      remained moribund, starved of British investment capital and      survived through the British protectionist system reserved      for primary producers of the colonial empire. That      arrangement created a condition of chronic surplus labor and      forced segments of the Caribbean labor force to seek their      fortunes elsewhere such as in the banana fields of Central      America, the sugar-cane fields of Cuba, the construction      complex of the Panama Canal, and the industrialized factories      in the United States at the advent of World War 1. In the      post-second world war, thousands fled the region to work in      the industrial and service enterprises of the United Kingdom.       In the post-colonial years in an age of global      protectionism, most Caribbean countries opted for the      developmental strategy of industrialization by invitation      hiding behind the high walls of tariff barriers. That      resulted in an economy with an export producing primary      sector of sugar and banana and the new sector of light      manufacturing serving the needs of the domestic market. The      developmental strategy accelerated the movement from country      to town where the      limited manufacturing sector lacked the capacity to absorb      the burgeoning labor force. Salvation came through the export      of skilled and unskilled labor to the United States, Canada      and the United Kingdom.       The growth in the labor force has tapered off in the      contemporary period and the unemployment rate in April 2006      was estimated at 134,000 or 10.7 percent of the labor force.      Nonetheless, Jamaica has a precious stratum of own-account      workers estimated at 376,000. In the goods producing sector,      there are 200,000 people employed in agriculture, 105,000 in      construction and a mere 80,000 in manufacturing. Traditional      agriculture, particularly sugar-cane, there is an effort to      adapt that industry through the conversion of sugar-cane into      the fuel producing ethanol. The purchase of the sugar      industry by Brazilian investors should make the sugar      industry more viable and contribute to reducing Jamaica's      dependency on fossil fuel and with sufficient capacity to      export ethanol to the United States.       Jamaica's economy in the last decade has seen the expansion      of the alumina industry and a massive increase in the tourist      sector. Alumina and bauxite are highly capital intensive and      only 7,000 workers are absorbed in the mining industry. The      tourist industry is labor intensive but has failed to absorb      all those looking for work as the burgeoning squatter      settlements are rampant in the parishes where tourism is      concentrated.       Jamica has made some headway in the export of manufacturing      goods. That sector exports approximately 700m in 2006 and if      Jamaica is going to absorb its surplus labor problem, there      will have to be exponential growth in that sector of the      economy, particularly in agro-products.       The Jamaica exporting sector is assisted by state policy.      Members of the Jamaica Exporters Association are eligible for      loans with reduced interest rates. But what is desperately      needed is a strategic developmental plan that brings together      venture capitalists from abroad and Jamaica's indigenous      bourgeoisie aimed at creating large scale production of      juices like guava, june plum, etc. aimed at flooding both the      European and the United States market. Micro-enterprises      cannot compete in a global market and Jamaica is in need of      large scale production aimed at mega-markets to absorb      Jamaica's surplus workers.       All the successful countries that have made the transition      from fledgling developing countries, like Singapore, South      Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and China, have made it through      adopting an export-oriented strategy.       What is required is the emergence of an entrepreneurial      class with a clear understanding of the complexity of      globalization that will partner with government to build that      export capacity. In this age of globalization, CARICOM must      look outwards and build the necessary bridges with the      Caribbean Diaspora to ensure that the Caribbean is not      trapped in the backwater of globalization."

I salute you . . . We of the Army      Air Force are proud of you.

The      Department of Defense (DoD) fully supports the national goal      of exploration and development of our nation's offshore oil      and gas resources. The DoD, the Department of the Interior,      and affected states have worked together successfully for      many years to ensure unrestricted access to critical military      testing and training areas, while also enabling oil and gas      exploration in accordance with applicable laws and      regulations.       DoD conducts essential military testing and training in      many of the 26 Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) planning areas.      Prior      analysis and existing agreements with Interior recognize that      areas east of the 86 deg. 41' line in the Gulf of Mexico      (commonly know as the ``Military Mission Line'') are      especially critical to DoD due to the number and diversity of      military testing and training activities conducted there now,      and those planned for the future. In those areas east of the      Military Mission Line, drilling structures and associated      development would be incompatible with military activities,      such as missile flights, low-flying drone aircraft, weapons      testing, and training.       As the planning process for Interior's new 5-year OCS oil      and gas leasing program proceeds, DoD will continue both to      evaluate its military requirements and to work with Interior      to ensure the 2007-2012 oil and gas program, and any future      lease sales resulting from it, strike the proper balance      between our nation's energy and national security goals.

Wouldn't it be an absurd result if you can kill an American citizen abroad--Awlaki--whatever his name was--the President targeted him for assassination because he was an American citizen who went to Yemen to engage in an act of terrorism against the United States. The President went through an Executive legal process, targeted him for assassination and a drone attack killed him and we are all better off.

As the storm      descended on Washington, the Kentucky Republican's old-     fashioned filibuster Wednesday filled the attention void on      Twitter and cable TV. If only his reasoning matched the      showmanship.       Shortly before noon, Senator Paul began talking filibuster      against John Brennan's nomination to lead the CIA. The tactic      is rarely used in the Senate and was last seen in 2010. But      Senator Paul said an ``alarm'' had to be sounded about the      threat to Americans from their own government. He promised to      speak ``until the President says, no, he will not kill you at      a cafe.'' He meant by a military drone. He's apparently      serious, though his argument isn't.       Senator Paul had written the White House to inquire about      the possibility of a drone strike against a U.S. citizen on      American soil. Attorney General Eric Holder replied that the      U.S. hasn't and ``has no intention'' to bomb any specific      territory. Drones are limited to the remotest area of      conflict zones like Pakistan and Yemen. But as a hypothetical      constitutional matter, Mr. Holder acknowledged the President      can authorize the use of lethal military force within U.S.      territory.       This shocked Senator Paul, who invoked the Constitution and      Miranda rights. Under current U.S. policy, Mr. Paul mused on      the floor, Jane Fonda could have been legally killed by a      Hellfire missile during her tour of Communist Hanoi in 1972.      A group of noncombatants sitting in public view in Houston      may soon be pulverized, he declared.       Calm down, Senator. Mr. Holder is right, even if he doesn't      explain the law very well. The U.S. Government cannot      randomly target American citizens on U.S. soil or anywhere      else."

Because some of the standards are a little bit loose--whether you are near someone. Apparently, we are not counting civilians who are killed by drone strikes if they are males between the ages of 16 and 50. If they were close to the people we are targeting, we just count them as other militants. Are we going to do that in the United States?"

In particular, both of those were military strikes on our country with imminent and, indeed, grievous loss of life that flowed from it. Few, if any, disagree that the U.S. Government may act swiftly to prevent a military attack which would mean immediate loss of life. The question Attorney General Holder was asked three different times was whether the U.S. Government could take a U.S. citizen, who was suspected of being a terrorist, on U.S. soil, who was not engaged in any imminent threat to life or bodily harm, simply sitting at a cafe--could the U.S. Government use a drone strike to kill that U.S. citizen on U.S. soil."

The reason it has to be answered is because our foreign drone strike program does kill noncombatants. They may argue they are conspiring or they may some day be combatants, but if that is the same standard we are going to be using in the United States, it is a far different country than I know about. Ours is a country where dissent, vocal dissent, even vehement, vociferous dissent as far as whether our country should go to war, whether our country should raise taxes, lower taxes, has always been allowed. We allow a great deal of dissent in our country.

The matrix contains the names of terrorism suspects arrayed      against an accounting of the resources being marshaled to      track them down, including sealed indictments and clandestine      operations. U.S. officials said the database is designed to      go beyond existing kill lists, mapping plans for the      ``disposition'' of suspects beyond the reach of American      drones.       Although the matrix is a work in progress, the effort to      create it reflects a reality setting in among the nation's      counterterrorism ranks: The United States' conventional wars      are winding down, but the government expects to continue      adding names to kill or capture lists for years.       Among senior Obama administration officials, there is a      broad consensus that such operations are likely to be      extended at least another decade. Given the way al-Qaida      continues to metastasize, some officials said no clear end is      in sight.       ``We can't possibly kill everyone who wants to harm us,'' a      senior administration said. ``It's a necessary part of what      we do . . . We're not going to wind up in 10 years in a world      of everybody holding hands any saying, ``We love America.''       That timeline suggests that the United States has reached      only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on      terrorism. Targeting lists that were regarded as finite      emergency measures after the attacks of September 11 are now      fixtures of the national security apparatus. The rosters      expand and contract with the pace of drone strikes but never      go to zero.       Meanwhile, a significant milestone looms: The number of      militants and civilians killed in the drone campaign over 10      years will soon exceed 3,000 by certain estimates."

The administration has taken tentative      steps toward greater transparency, formally acknowledging for      the first time the United States' use of armed drones.       Less visible is the extent to which Obama has      institutionalized the highly classified practice of targeted      killing, transforming ad-hoc elements into a counterterrorism      infrastructure capable of sustaining a seemingly permanent      war.       Spokesmen for the White House, the National      Counterterrorism Center, the CIA and other agencies declined      to comment on the matrix. Privately, officials acknowledge      that the development of the matrix is part of a series of      moves, in Washington and overseas, to embed counterterrorism      tools into U.S. policy for the long haul.       White House counterterrorism adviser John O. Brennan is      seeking to codify the administration's approach to generating      capture/kill lists, part of a broader effort . . .       CIA Director David Petraeus is pushing for an expansion of      the agency's fleet of armed drones. The proposal, which would      need White House approval, reflects the agency's      transformation into a paramilitary force and makes clear that      it does not intend to dismantle its drone program and return      to pre-September 11 focus on gathering intelligence.       The U.S. Joint Special Operations Command, which carried      out the raid that killed bin Laden, has moved command teams      into suspected terrorist hotbeds in Africa. A rugged U.S.      outpost in Djibouti has been transformed into a launchpad for      counterterrorism operations across the Horn of Africa and      into the Middle East.       The Joint Special Operations Command has also established a      secret targeting center across the Potomac River from      Washington. The current and former U.S. official said the      elite command's targeting cells have traditionally been      located along the front lines of its missions, including Iraq      and Afghanistan. But the joint committee has now created a      national capital region task force that is a 15-minute      commute from the White House so it can be more directly      involved in deliberations about the al-Qaida list.       The developments were described by current and former      officials from the White House as well as intelligence and      counterterrorism agencies. Most spoke on the condition of      anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.

National      security analysts and former U.S. military officials      increasingly argue that such tactical gains are outweighed by      the substantial cost of the targeted killing program,      including growing anti-American sentiment and recruiting      support for al-Qaida.

I think if that number were released, if that number were made public, it would concern you even more because you may well find out a lot of the people--and we have seen some of the strikes on television, with people in their cars, people walking around without weapons, people eating dinner, people at home in their houses. I am not saying these are good people necessarily, I am just saying the drone strike program we have in place currently seems to have a very low threshold for whom they kill.

I had the privilege of visiting our soldiers overseas in Afghanistan with a number of Senators in January. We have seen up close, through detailed video, the capabilities of drones, capabilities that were not there that many years ago. Questions such as this would have never arisen a number of years ago because the technology was not there. But now the technology is there. With that given technology, that raises new questions. That is why I think so many Americans are appreciative of the work by Senator Paul to specifically ask questions that have never been asked before because the technology was not there before. Now we have the technology, we have the know-how, and the question continues to be asked."

The one thing that should not be lost here is that we are not arguing about the use of drones, particularly in defense of our military. When people are shooting at our soldiers I want the best equipment in the world that we have to defend them and to win our battles. That is something I think we should all want."

Many of the drone strikes overseas have been noncombatants--at least at the time they are killed they were not involved in combat. I don't think it is too much to ask the President to clarify that what he means is the United States can repel invasion, the United States can repel attacks, whether they are American citizens or not. We don't have a dispute with that. Our concern is when you look at the drone program overseas, a lot of people are sitting around eating, walking, sleeping in their house--that that is not the sort of a program I can imagine using in the United States. I cannot imagine we are going to have drone strikes on people while they are asleep in their home or when they are out eating in a cafe or eating in a restaurant. I cannot imagine that is the standard we are going to use. Maybe it is just a misunderstanding. Maybe the President can clear this up."

I recognize that military awards should be updated as the tactics of warfare change. Drones and cyber warfare play a role in the defense of this great country, and there is no question that each member of our military plays a crucial role in protecting our Nation and every American.

62ae1c68fb56401ee3ed0ea5dc3db96f,2013-03-11,EXECUTIVE SESSION,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Senator Rand Paul may have staged a Senate-shaking      filibuster Wednesday, but his was actually only the second      most significant Republican filibuster of the day.       In a vote just before Mr. Paul, the junior senator from      Kentucky, tried to blockade the nomination of John Brennan as      director of central intelligence over drone policy, the      Senate failed to end debate on the nomination of Caitlin J.      Halligan of New York to a seat on the federal appeals court      for the District of Columbia.       The filibuster of Ms. Halligan didn't blow up on Twitter      the way Mr. Paul's impressive 12-hour stand did. But of the      two, it was the one that could renew a feud over rules      governing filibusters and how the Senate handles high-level      judicial nominations--an issue that has torn the chamber for      years.       Democrats are already in discussions on how to respond to      the Halligan filibuster. They believe Republicans are dead      set against confirming qualified Obama administration      nominees to the United States Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia Circuit. They accuse Republicans of      exaggerating their objections to Ms. Halligan to justify a      filibuster under a 2005 agreement that short-circuited the      last partisan showdown over filling judicial vacancies.       That deal, crafted by the famous Gang of 14, put its      signatories on record as saying they would not block      confirmation votes on appeals court judges without      ``extraordinary circumstances'' as determined by each      individual. While only members of the gang signed it, it      became informal Senate policy and defused a crisis that had      Republicans threatening to execute the ``nuclear option'' and      bar filibusters against judicial nominees by a simple      majority vote instead of with the 67 votes historically      needed to change Senate rules.       It also led to President George W. Bush winning three      appointments to the appeals court often considered a feeder      to the Supreme Court, giving conservatives an advantage on      the influential panel, which hears      many federal-powers cases. In its current makeup, the court      consists of four judges appointed by Republican presidents      and three appointed by President Bill Clinton, with four      vacancies--the most ever on that court.       In filibustering Ms. Halligan, several Republicans cited      extraordinary circumstances arising from her earlier work as      the solicitor general for the State of New York, particularly      on a case against gun manufacturers.       ``Ms. Halligan advanced the novel legal theory that gun      manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers contributed to a      `public nuisance' of illegal handguns in the state,'' said      Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on      the Judiciary Committee, accusing her of judicial activism.      ``Therefore, she argued, gun manufacturers should be liable      for the criminal conduct of third parties.''       Democrats cried foul. The real reason she was blocked, they      say, is that Republicans do not want to see the balance of      power on the D.C. appeals court shifted. They say that Ms.      Halligan was acting in her official capacity representing the      State of New York, not as a jurist, and that Republicans have      abandoned the extraordinary circumstances test engineered by      the Gang of 14.       ``If you go back to that history of what occurred back      then, there is a real question of whether they have broken      the deal now,'' said Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New      Mexico. ``This is a key circuit for the country. What they      are doing is not allowing these consensus candidate judges to      get votes.''       Mr. Udall has been among a group of relatively newer      members of the Senate clamoring for significant changes in      the rules governing filibusters. One demand is that senators      act more like Mr. Paul, and take the floor to make their case      when they are trying to block a vote. In January, working to      avoid a divisive fight, Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada      Democrat and majority leader, and Senator Mitch McConnell of      Kentucky, the Republican leader, struck a deal making some      modest changes in filibuster rules.       But those changes have done little so far this session to      curb filibusters, as evidenced by the vote on Ms. Halligan      and the politically charged obstacles raised to confirmation      votes on Mr. Brennan and Chuck Hagel, a former Republican      senator who found himself on the receiving end of a      Republican filibuster before winning confirmation as      secretary of defense. The filibuster is alive and well in the      Senate and, as Mr. Paul showed, may even be enjoying      resurgence as grand theater.       Democrats say that despite what they see as clear      provocation, they are in no hurry to change the new rules      after just two months in place. They say they are more      inclined to explore new ways to confront Republicans over the      vacancies.       Mr. Udall says one option might be for the president to      make multiple nominations, in effect daring Republicans to      find ways to cite extraordinary circumstances in multiple      instances.       ``Rather than putting just one up, we should put before the      Senate all four and expose what is happening here,'' said Mr.      Udall, who acknowledged that Senate Democrats would need      White House cooperation.       ``We need to design a strategy to counter the Republicans,      and we are going to need the president,'' he said.       The fight will take time to unfold. Democrats say they will      wait to see how Republicans respond to future appeals court      nominees. But a series of filibusters against what they view      as acceptable nominees could quickly bring to a head the push      for a change in Senate rules."

a792063effdc66cc08017090c54f96c8,2013-03-14,CONGRESSIONAL PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS UNVEILS THE BACK TO WORK BUDGET,Alan,Grayson,Democrat,M,FLORIDA,660,"This week, amid the hullabaloo over President Barack      Obama's Deficit Dinner Diplomacy and Senator Rand Paul's 13-     hour filibuster-cum-dissertation on drone strikes and civil      liberties, financial news-watchers touted a milestone in      their lives of Market Worship. We speak, of course, of the      Dow Jones Industrial Average, which on Tuesday hit an ``all-     time high'' of 14,253. The good times rolled steadily on      through the week, and the Dow closed Friday at 14,397.       Of course, the notion that these were ``record'' highs was      not, strictly speaking, true. As Jeff Cox at CNBC pointed      out, ``In inflation-adjusted dollars, the Dow would need to      hit 15,731 to break the record.'' Nevertheless, the exciting      new ordinal number sitting on the stock market index set off      a chorus of hallelujahs. After all, this was the highest mark      it had hit since October 2007. (Of course, if we recall      correctly, that was right around the time that all of our      more recent tragic economic events began to occur.)       The fluctuations of the Dow are typically pored over by the      media in the same way that ancient oracles pierced through      the entrails of birds, seeking for whatever path might lead      to the most prosperity. And in the world of politics,      partisans on both sides are quick to point to the Dow as      generic confirmation that their policies are working as long      as the story suits their narrative anyway.       And these narratives can get wild and weird and wooly      quickly. Seemingly within moments of the Dow's peak, ``Dow      36,000'' author James Glassman was on the pages of Bloomberg      View, taking credit for this and crowing about how his old,      failed predictions were well on the way to coming true.       Of course, as Jonathan Chait points out, Glassman has to      toss out the entire underlying thesis of ``Dow 36,000.'' (He      and coauthor Kevin Hassett ``theorized that the stock market,      circa 1999, was being so undervalued that it would have been      at 36,000 in the days ahead of the massive tech-bubble burst      as opposed to theorizing that ``someday, maybe the Dow would      hit 36,000. Probably. You know, just watch'') in order to      claim vindication now.       Former Reagan domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett just      called Glassman a ``nitwit'' and left it at that.       All of which leads to an obvious point: although we      recognize that the long-term trend of the stock market is      that it has an overall upward trajectory--punctuated in      snapshots by the susurrations of the greed/fear cycle--it is      nevertheless catnip for a lot of wild-eyed prognosticators,      and the over-reliance of using the stock market as evidence      of economic recovery, or the proof of economic fundamentals,      is acute.       So what does it say about the Dow that it could hit this      dizzying new height--impressive by any measure in any era,      post-crash or otherwise--at a time when the overall global      economic outlook is so dismal and the domestic recovery is      barely felt by the citizens who sacrificed their capital to      save the world from calamity?       It says that we should be gravely concerned. It says that      we have a two-tiered economy, one where profits flow and      another where risks lurk. It says that a lot of people are      being left behind, and if October 2007 is any guide, it says      that this display of prosperity may simply be an illusion.       The distribution of the stock market's largesse has been      the most un-egalitarian aspect of American economics for      years. A full 50 percent of all capital gains go not to the      richest 1 percent of Americans, but to the richest 0.1      percent, according to The Washington Post.       But the stock market's persistent upward climb since the      spring of 2009 has revealed another massive disparity: the      multinational corporate machinery that generates stock gains      has become unmoored from the economic reality in which the      majority of Americans live and die.       The Dow hit its peak this week amid a host of gloomy global      economic forecasts. Back in January, the World Bank ``sharply      reduced its estimate of global economic growth in 2013,      projecting that the downturn in Europe and the United States'      fiscal problems will continue to weigh on investment and      spending.'' The World Bank's take on U.S. growth was      similarly dismal--its 1.9 percent forecast for the coming      year was less than the most pessimistic estimates of our own      Federal Reserve."

This prestigious award was given at the 2013 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.   The Intel International Science and Engineering Fair is the world's largest international science competition for high school students, and this year it provided a forum for approximately 1,500 students from 70 countries, regions, and territories to showcase their independent research. Since 2008, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has selected three projects to receive awards for exemplary work in addiction science, and I am extremely proud that a winning project came from the hard work and dedication of one of my constituents.   Ms. Sonksen's project, ``Determining the Behavioral and Physiological Effects of Pentedrone-Based Bath Salts on Drosophila Melangaster,'' studied the effects of two versions of the drugs called ``bath salts'' on the common fruit fly. She looked at three possible effects: mortality, feeding patterns, and activity levels. Many of the flies died from exposure to bath salts, and many others decreased their feeding activity. Her research showed that the substances, while commonly considered stimulants, acted more like hallucinogens, with the flies appearing to be in a daze.   I am proud that Ms. Sonksen not only took the time and energy to submit an award winning project but also focused her efforts on such an important issue. Bath salts are emerging synthetic stimulants that often contain amphetamine-like chemicals. Addiction and abuse of these drugs has dramatically increased over the past few years and has resulted in a number of hospitalizations and even deaths. I appreciate the awareness Ms. Sonksen has raised to the issues surrounding bath salts through her research and submission of her project.   In closing, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring Aliana Sonksen's Addiction Science Award and her hopeful future of contributing to addiction science for many years to come."

A potential move also undermines the synergies that currently exist between the schoolhouse and the experimental pilots. Finally, with Fort Rucker being the Army proponent for unmanned aerial vehicles--UAVs, it is crucial that the ATTC be able to leverage the expertise associated with this proponency to conduct its tests on UAVs."

Petraeus, President Obama      now has a chance to appoint a new CIA director.      Unfortunately, one of the leading candidates for the job is      John O. Brennan, who is largely responsible for America's      current flawed counterterrorism strategy, which relies too      heavy on drone strikes that frequently kills civilians and      provide al Qaeda with countless new recruits. Rather than      keeping us safe, this strategy is putting the United States      at greater risk.       For all of the Obama administration's foreign policy      successes--from ending the war in Iraq to killing Osama bin      Laden--the most enduring policy legacy of the past 4 years      may well turn out to be an approach to counterterrorism that      American officials call the Yemen model, a mixture of drone      strikes and Special Forces raids targeting al Qaeda leaders.       Mr. Brennan is the President's chief counterterrorism      adviser and the architect of this model. In a recent speech,      he claimed that there was ``little evidence that these      actions are generating widespread anti-American sentiment or      recruits for AQAP,'' referring to al Qaeda in the Arabian      Peninsula."

Another told CNN, after      a failed strike, ``I would not be surprised if 100 tribesmen      joined al Qaeda as a result of the latest drone mistake.''       Rather than promote the author of a failing strategy, we      need a CIA director who will halt the agency's creeping      militarization and restore it to what it does best:      collecting human intelligence. It is an intelligence agency,      not a lightweight version of Joint Special Operations      Command. And until America wins the intelligence war,      missiles will continue to hit the wrong targets, kill too      many civilians and drive young men into the waiting arms of      our enemies.       Without accurate on-the-ground intelligence, our policies      will fail. George W. Bush launched two major ground      invasions, and Mr. Obama has tried several smaller wars.      Neither strategy has worked. In Yemen, which has been the      laboratory for Mr. Obama's shadow wars, AQAP has more than      tripled in size after 3 years of drone strikes. When the      United States started bombing Yemen in 2009, AQAP had just      200 to 300 fighters. Today, the State Department estimates it      has a few thousand. Since 2009, the group has attempted to      attack America on three occasions, coming closest on December      25, 2009, when a would-be suicide bomber narrowly failed to      bring down an airliner over Detroit. When it tries again--and      it will--the organization will be available to draw upon much      deeper ranks.       Not surprisingly, American officials reject the claim that      current policy is exacerbating the problem. In June 2011, Mr.      Brennan declared that ``there hasn't been a single collateral      death because of the exceptional proficiency, precision of      the capabilities we've been able to develop.'' This came      almost exactly a year after a botched drone attack in Yemen      killed a deputy governor and four of his bodyguards instead      of the intended target.       Under Mr. Brennan's guidance, the United States has also      adopted a controversial method for determining how many      civilians it has killed, counting all military-age males in a      strike zone as combatants. This means that Abdulrahman al      Awlaki, a 16-year-old American citizen killed by a drone in      October, was classified as a militant despite evidence that      he was simply a shy teenager whose father happened to be      Anwar al Awlaki, who had been killed by American missiles 2      weeks earlier.       The strikes Mr. Brennan asks the President to approve      frequently lead to civilian casualties. Indeed, the first      strike Mr. Obama ordered on Yemen, in December 2009,      destroyed a Bedouin village that was mistaken for a terrorist      training camp. American missiles killed more than 50 people,      including 35 women and children. Watching that strike live on      a grainy feed the military calls Kill TV, Jeh Johnson, the      Pentagon's top lawyer, later admitted, ``if I were Catholic,      I'd have to go to confession.''       Mr. Petraeus's departure presents Mr. Obama with an      opportunity to halt the CIA's drift toward becoming a      paramilitary organization and put it back on course. For all      of the technological advances America has made in a decade of      fighting al Qaeda, it still needs all of the old tricks it      learned in the days before spy satellites and drones.       More and better intelligence from sources on the ground      would result in more accurate targeting and fewer civilian      casualties. That would be a Yemen model that actually worked      and a lasting and effective counterterrorism legacy for Mr.      Obama's second term."
5b759dbf52557d364b3f82d1b86daeb8,2013-02-06,NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES,Louie,Gohmert,Republican,M,TEXAS,696,"A relatively unnoticed article by Associated Press reporter      Kimberly Dozier 2 weeks ago outlined new Obama administration      policy changes which consolidated power for authorizing drone      attacks and assassinations      under political appointees within the White House.       The article identifies White House Counterterrorism Chief      John Brennan as the official assuming the role of Obama's de      facto assassination czar, raising concerns even within the      Obama administration that the White House is increasingly      turning into ``a pseudo-military headquarters'' under the      direction of just a few senior Obama administration      officials.       Adding to these concerns are serious questions about      Brennan's qualification for this role.       Even before the 2008 election, eyebrows were raised over      Brennan's role in the Obama campaign. An employee of The      Analysis Corporation, of which Brennan was CEO, had      improperly accessed passport information for Hillary Clinton,      Obama's Democratic primary challenger at the time, and GOP      nominee John McCain. At the time, Brennan was a top adviser      to the Obama campaign, and Brennan's employee was not fired.      One of the key witnesses in the case was found murdered in      his car outside his church while the investigation was still      ongoing.       Brennan was involved in administration intrigue related to      the release of convicted Libyan Pan Am Flight 103 bomber from      a Scottish jail in August 2009. At the time of Megrahi's      release, when he returned to Libya to a national hero's      welcome, Brennan described the release as ``unfortunate,      inappropriate, and wrong'' and called for his reimprisonment.      However, Obama administration documents obtained by The      Sunday Times revealed that the White House had secretly      informed Scottish authorities that they found compassionate      release more palatable than the reimprisonment of Megrahi in      Libya.       Brennan also came under fire after would-be underwear      bomber Umar Farouk--and I won't try that last name--nearly      brought down a U.S.-bound Northwest Airlines flight on      Christmas Day 2009. British intelligence authorities had      notified their U.S. counterparts of an ``Umar Farouk''      meeting with al Qaeda cleric Anwar al Awlaki in Yemen, and      Umar Farouk's father had warned of his son's increasing      extremism to CIA officials at the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria.

Back in June, I profiled Brennan here at PJ Media. Some of      `Jihad' John's recent highlights include:       March 2008: John McCain's passport information leaked from      John Brennan's company during presidential campaign (key      witness murdered during investigation)       April 2008: Brennan tells the New York Times that US      government official must stop ``Iran-bashing''       Feb 2010: Brennan attacks critics of Obama Admin's handling      of ``underwear bomber'' Abdulmutallab as a criminal, not a      terrorist, saying that critics are ``serving the goals of Al-     Qaeda''       May 2010: Brennan says he wants to build up ``Hezbollah      moderates''       May 2010: Brennan defends `Jihad' as a `legitimate tenet of      Islam'       June 2010: Washington Times editorial slams Brennan,      saying, ``President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser      knows very little about terrorism, and that's scary for      America.''       Aug 2010: Brennan storms out of meeting with Washington      Times editorial staff after he claims he was misquoted by      newspaper and editor begins reading Brennan's own quotes back      to him out loud       Sept 2010: Known HAMAS operative given escorted tour of      National Counterterrorism Center       May 2012: Brennan implicated in major White House      intelligence breach involving UK/Saudi Al-Qaeda infiltrator       Aug 2012: Brennan attacks critics of politically-driven      White House intelligence leaks       Sept 2012: House Intel Committee Chairman Mike Rogers says      changes in CIA's Benghazi attack talking points blaming      Mohammed video happened under deputies committee chaired by      Brennan       Again, these are just some of John Brennan's highlights. We      could also add his laughable claims of no collateral      casualties from his drone assassination program or his      defense of trying Al-Qaeda operations chief Khalid Sheikh      Mohammed in federal court or his role in the White House      back-door dealing with the UK on the release of Libyan Pan Am      Flight 103 bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi or his reference to      Jerusalem as ``Al-Quds'' in a NYU speech or his claims that      the 20 percent recidivism rate for GITMO detainees (those who      returned to terrorism) was ``not that bad''. But that would      be piling on.       What should be clear is that John Brennan's role in Barack      Obama's disastrous first term should preclude him from any      further service in the second term, let alone a promotion."

According to the UN Drug Control Programme's 2000 report, coca cultivation in Peru declined 82,201 hectares between 1990-2000 and increased by 82,500 hectares in Colombia in the same period. Eradication without alternative development moved production from Colombia's Guaviare province to Putumayo province; now it is moving to Narino province and Ecuador. Since massive fumigation efforts were launched in December, there has been no change in the US price of cocaine (according to DEA 5/23/01). What is perhaps the most troubling is that there are complaints of illness and environmental degradation resulting from the fumigation policy our country is promoting. As long as US users crave drugs, greedy drug lords will find new territory to produce their product. As long as there is crushing poverty in the region, there will be a supply of poor farmers to grow coca and poppy.

0196132131e9c9e28a9882ad9020183e,2009-08-05,SITUATION IN YEMEN,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Washington.--American officials say they are seeing the      first evidence that dozens of fighters with Al Qaeda, and a      small handful of the terrorist group's leaders, are moving to      Somalia and Yemen from their principal haven in Pakistan's      tribal areas. In communications that are being watched      carefully at the Pentagon, the White House and the Central      Intelligence Agency, the terrorist groups in all three      locations are now communicating more frequently, and      apparently trying to coordinate their actions, the officials      said.       Some aides to President Obama attribute the moves to      pressure from intensified drone attacks against Qaeda      operatives in Pakistan, after years of unsuccessful American      efforts to dislodge the terrorist group from their haven      there.       But there are other possible explanations. Chief among them      is the growth of the jihadist campaigns in both Somalia and      Yemen, which may now have some of the same appeal for      militants that Iraq did after the American military invasion      there in 2003.       Somalia is now a failed state that bears some resemblance      to Afghanistan before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, while      Yemen's weak government is ineffectually trying to combat the      militants, American officials say.       The shift of fighters is still small, perhaps a few dozen,      and there is no evidence that the top leaders--Osama bin      Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri--are considering a move from their      refuge in the Pakistani tribal areas, according to more than      half a dozen senior administration, military and      counterterrorism officials interviewed in recent days.       Most officials would not comment on the record about the      details of what they are seeing, because of the sensitivity      of the intelligence information they are gathering.       Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director, said in remarks here      on Thursday that the United States must prevent Al Qaeda from      creating a new sanctuary in Yemen or Somalia.       The steady trickle of fighters from Pakistan could worsen      the chaos in Somalia, where an Islamic militant group, the      Shabab, has attracted hundreds of foreign jihadists in its      quest to topple the weak moderate Islamist government in      Mogadishu. It could also swell the ranks of a growing menace      in Yemen, where militants now control large areas of the      country outside the capital.       ``I am very worried about growing safe havens in both      Somalia and Yemen, specifically because we have seen Al Qaeda      leadership, some leaders, start to flow to Yemen,'' Adm. Mike      Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in      remarks at the Brookings Institution here on May 18.       For the United States, the movement creates opportunities      as well as risks. With the Obama administration focusing its      fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda on the havens in      Afghanistan and Pakistan, a shift of fighters and some      leaders to new locations could complicate American efforts to      strike a lasting blow.       But in the tribal areas of Pakistan, Qaeda and Taliban      forces have drawn for protection on Pashtun tribes with whom      they have deep familial and tribal ties. A move away from      those areas could expose Qaeda leaders to betrayal, while      communications among militants in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen      have      created a new opportunity for American intelligence to zero      in on insurgents who gave up many electronic communication      devices shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks to avoid      detection.       A senior Obama administration official attributed some of      the movement to ``the enormous heat we've been putting on the      leadership and the mid-ranks'' with Predator strikes,      launched from both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Mr. Obama's      strategy so far has been to intensify many of the strikes      begun under the Bush administration.       ``There are indications that some Al Qaeda terrorists are      starting to see the tribal areas of Pakistan as a tough place      to be,'' said an American counterterrorism official. ``It is      likely that a small number have left the region as a result.      Among these individuals, some have probably ended up in      Somalia and Yemen, among other places. The Al Qaeda      terrorists who are leaving the tribal areas of Pakistan are      predominantly foot soldiers.''       Measuring the numbers of these movements is almost as      difficult as assessing the motivations of those who are on      their way out of the tribal areas.       But American officials say there is evidence of a shift.      One senior American military official who follows Africa      closely said that more than 100 foreign fighters had trained      in terrorism camps in Somalia alone in the past few years.      Another senior military officer said that Qaeda operatives      and confederates in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia had stepped      up communications with one another.       ``What really has us worried is that they're communicating      with each other much more--Al Qaeda in Pakistan, Somalia and      Yemen,'' the senior military officer said. ``They're asking,      `What do you need? Financing? Fighters?' ''       Mr. Obama's strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan placed      the defeat of Al Qaeda as the No. 1 objective, largely to      make sure that the group could not plot new attacks against      the United States.       Thus, the movement of the fighters, and the disruption that      causes, has been interpreted by some of the president's top      advisers as a sign of success.       But the emergence of new havens, from which Al Qaeda and      its affiliates could plot new attacks, raises difficult      questions for the United States on how to combat the growing      threat, and creates the possibility that increased missile      strikes are in the offing in Yemen and Somalia.       ``Those are issues that I think the international community      is going to have to address because Al Qaeda is not going      away,'' Admiral Mullen told a Senate committee on May 21.       The C.I.A. says its drone attacks in Pakistan have      disrupted Al Qaeda's operations and damaged the group's      senior ranks. American officials say that strikes have killed      11 of the top 20 Qaeda leaders in the past year.       ``Al Qaeda has been hit by drones and it has generated a      lot of insecurity among them,'' said Talat Masood, a retired      Pakistani general and military analyst in Islamabad.       ``Many among them are uneasy and it is possible that they      are leaving for Somalia and other jihadi battle fronts,'' he      said. ``The hard core, however, will like to stay on.''       Without singling out any countries, Adm. Eric T. Olson, the      head of the Special Operations Command, spoke in general      terms last week about how the increased Pakistani military      operations in the Swat Valley and early indications of a new      Pakistani offensive in South Waziristan had put militants on      the run.       ``As the Pakistanis are applying pressure,'' Admiral Olson      told a House panel, ``it will shift some of the sanctuaries      to other places.''"

I continue to      support transparency. But it would be a terrible mistake to      hold up David Barron's nomination over this issue.       First, and most importantly, it is a mistake to conflate      the issues of the appointment of David Barron and disclosure      of the memos. Barron is a highly qualified lawyer who I know      personally to be thoughtful, considerate, open-minded, and      brilliant. His confirmation would put in place a judge who      will be absolutely vigilant in his protection of civil      liberties and his insistence that executive power be      constrained by the rule of law. That long-term value should      not be sacrificed because of a short-term battle over memos      that every Senator already has the opportunity to review.       There can be no doubt that Barron would be an excellent      independent judge, and would faithfully exercise his      authority to protect Americans' rights and to keep government      honest and constrained. As former judge and now Stanford Law      Professor Michael McConnell has noted, Barron ``has supported      efforts to adopt laws to enable judicial review of executive      actions that might otherwise escape judicial review because      of lack of standing, and has written powerfully about the      need for constitutional limits on executive excesses.''      Indeed, as head of the Office of Legal Counsel in 2009,      Barron himself withdrew five OLC memos written during the      prior administration to authorize controversial interrogation      techniques such as waterboarding. And fellow Harvard Law      Professor John F. Manning, a conservative who clerked for      Judge Robert Bork and Justice Antonin Scalia, has accurately      described Barron as ``undeniably brilliant'' and ``an      unusually talented and careful lawyer'' who will ``understand      and faithfully carry out the duties of a circuit judge.''       Second, the administration has in fact made available to      all Senators any and all memos Barron wrote concerning the      targeting of al-Awlaki--the core of the issue Sen. Paul is      concerned about. So if Sen. Paul and any other Senator want      to review Barron's reasoning in full, they are free to do so.      Moreover, the administration also made available to the      Senate, and ultimately to the public, a ``White Paper'' said      to be drawn from the Barron memo (though written long after      he left office). Thus, no Senator need be in the dark about      the Administration's reasoning, and the public also has a      pretty good idea as well.       Indeed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit      recently ruled that a redacted version of the al-Awlaki memo      can and should be disclosed, largely because much of its      reasoning had already been made public in the White Paper.      Thus, while I fully support the public disclosure of the      memo, redacted to protect sources and methods, every Senator      already has full access to the memo, and therefore can make      an informed judgment on advice and consent. And the public      also has a good sense of what it says.       Notably, Senators Ron Wyden, Mark Udall, and Martin      Heinrich, all members of the Intelligence Committee, wrote a      letter to Attorney General Eric Holder in November 2013,      after reviewing the memo on the killing of al-Awlaki, and      stating their view the killing was ``a legitimate use of the      authority granted to the President.'' They went on to urge      the administration to be more forthcoming about the legal      limits on the use of force against U.S. persons in other      cases, beyond what the memo apparently had sanctioned, but      did not question the legality of the action authorized.       Sen. Paul's op-ed notes that the Office of Legal Counsel      may have written more than one memo on targeted killing,      which is quite possible. But the administration has disclosed      to the Senators the full, unredacted versions of any memo      authorizing the killing of Americans, the issue Sen. Paul      raises in his op-ed.       Finally, holding up Barron's nomination is unlikely to      expedite disclosure of the memos. It will only undermine the      confirmation of someone who would make an excellent judge.      The Administration has been ordered (unanimously) to release      the memo, and will in short order either comply with that      order or seek further review. Barron has no control over that      decision, and should not be held hostage to it.       I am second to none in my support for transparency. And I      will continue to fight for that value on its own terms. But      it is a huge mistake to let our legitimate concerns about      transparency get in the way of the confirmation of a judge      who will faithfully protect our liberties and hold government      accountable--especially when the Senate already has been      given access to all the information they need to exercise      their ``advise and consent'' role. As a civil libertarian and      drone critic, I have no hesitation in saying that David      Barron should be confirmed."
9a7c12f481cb1f18ea79981ec09505b4,2011-11-09,TRIBUTE TO STEVE ARMS,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Williston.--Back in high school, Steve Arms thought he      might want to be a journalist. He'd grown up reading non-stop      and often sneaked books and a flashlight under the covers      when he was supposed to be asleep.       He changed direction shortly before graduating from      Burlington High School in 1977. During his junior and senior      years, a math teacher and a physics teacher ignited a fuse      that prompted Arms to become an engineer, inventor and      successful tech entrepreneur who runs a Vermont company with      55 employees and gross sales of $12.8 million in 2010.       ``I have a dream job. I can't believe I get paid to do      this,'' Arms said during an interview at MicroStrain, the      sensor company he founded and leads in Williston.       The company designs and sells tiny, highly sophisticated      sensors used in U.S. military drones, NASA rocket tests,      tracking devices and a range of industrial and medical      products. Arms founded the company when he was a Ph.D.      candidate at the University of Vermont, where he studied      engineering and biomechanics. His first product was a mini-     sensor used in arthroscopic knee surgeries that he began      selling after writing the federal grant to help fund the      development himself.       In the early days at his company, Arms typed up the      invoices, answered the phone and hustled sales in addition to      designing products. He slowly grew the company and says a      careful, conservative approach to expansion--no outside      investors and a pay-as-you go approach as much as possible--     allowed the business to thrive and continue developing      cutting-edge products as requested by various customers.      Because there were no outside money people demanding quick      growth, Arms and his staff had the time to try, fail and      retry new product design--in other words, innovate.       Now much of the work is solving problems for clients and      continuously pushing for new designs--and that's what science      education should teach as well, Arms said. Schools that help      young people use science and math to find solutions--whether      it's flood prevention or saving the rain forest--are on the      right track. ``Kids are amazingly creative and they really      want to make the world a better place,'' Arms said.       It can take MicroStrain up to a year to find certain      employees and the company regularly recruits out of state.      But many employees are Vermonters or returning Vermonters.      And Arms has had great success with summer internship      programs for college students, many of whom are studying      electrical engineering at local colleges and out-of-state      schools such as Clarkson, Stanford and MIT. Some interns      spend three summers at the company before they graduate.      MicroStrain regularly hires from the intern pool because the      interns are up to speed on the work and because they've      basically succeeded during an extended job interview.       As a student, Arms responded to teachers who were well      organized, animated and happy to let a curious student run      with questions. His foray into bioengineering happened      largely because his UVM work study job put him in a      department full of doctors and medical researchers. He loved      talking to them and soon was writing grants as part of his      job--a skill that came in handy when it was time for Arms to      found MicroStrain.       His advice for students is similar to what he gives his      three children, including a son at Reed College and twin      daughters at Champlain Valley Union High School. Arms was      never a grind who obsessed over getting As in everything and      he left some homework undone. He worked, but not obsessively.      One thing he did learn was to follow his interests and be      efficient--by paying attention in class, for example. ``Be in      the moment. . . . Make the most of your time when you are      there.''       Schools could help inspire a love of science by making it      real, he added. Simple props--chalk and a two-by-four, a      bicycle wheel--are great ways to teach calculus, physics and      other STEM topics. Computers are can be useful tools but they      do not guarantee engagement in class, he said.       Bringing speakers from STEM employers is another way to      reach students, as is career mentoring. Arms still remembers      the conversation he had with Sir John Charnley, who pioneered      modern hip replacement, after Charnley visited UVM to give a      lecture in which he detailed the series of failures he      experienced before his big medical breakthrough.       ``For me, that was just all I needed,'' Arms said. The talk      left him with the sense of: ``I'm not giving up either.''"

83834350c4b12360802b6607f0f95f36,2004-07-22,AN ARTICLE ABOUT MR. PAUL KLEBNIKOV,Mark,Souder,Republican,M,INDIANA,165,"American journalist Paul Klebnikov was shot to death      outside my office building on Friday. At least it used to be      my office. I worked with Klebnikov, Forbes magazine's      maverick correspondent, several times in the past 10 years,      sometimes in Moscow, sometimes in New York. Our paths crossed      often through one of Russia's wildest decades.       Eight years after we first met as he covered Boris      Yeltsin's 1996 presidential election, his murder brings      clarity: Nothing has changed. Brutal criminals still run amok      in Russia, operating with impunity and no fear of      prosecution.       Klebnikov had high hopes for Russia and was determined to      urge democracy along. He grew up in the United States,      cradled in the close-knit Russian American community; his      Russian skills were perfect and his devotion to the culture      ran deep. He blossomed in journalism just as the communist      bloc crumbled, and his unique understanding of ``the story''      in the region propelled his career.       As we toured the Russian countryside eight years ago, he      talked to peasants waiting in line to vote and grilled me      with questions, too. Had I run across billionaire Boris      Berezovsky in my work with the Yeltsin administration? I      hadn't. Klebnikov had recently been scratching the surface of      Berezovsky's brazen get-rich-quick schemes. He was convinced      there was much more to the oligarch. He was in town to      investigate him as well as to cover the elections.       Berezovsky was one of several super-wealthy men who had      back doors to Yeltsin's Kremlin. His popularity waxed and      waned, but as he amassed wealth he gained unparalleled power.      Experienced expatriates in Russia shared an essential rule:      Don't cross these brutal billionaires, ever, or you're likely      to go home in a box.       Klebnikov knew this well. In Russia the mafia kills every      day. He knew Paul Tatum, the Oklahoma entrepreneur who ran      afoul of Moscow's mafia and was shot dead just a few hundred      yards from a hotel he had founded and had fought against      Mayor Yuri Luzhkov to control. After Tatum's murder, Hizzoner      promised swift justice. We're still waiting.       Tatum had led a loud life in Moscow. Klebnikov told me he      knew Tatum's battle with city ``authorities'' was never a      sound strategy for survival. The Tatum murder shook him, but      he was determined to go forward with what grew into a series      of articles exposing Russian corruption. After all, he was a      reporter, not a businessman.       As a journalist, Klebnikov was the real deal. He was based      in New York through the 1990s but had more contacts in Moscow      than most reporters on the ground full time. During his      frequent trips to the region he accomplished more meetings      before lunch than many of us could pull off in a week.       Klebnikov listened as intently to the griping of a      pensioner as he did to the drone of politicians. He was quick      to the point, wasted no time, and drove to the center of his      story like a tank. Some thought he was bold,      others thought him brash, but everyone was reading.       ``Godfather of the Kremlin,'' his December 1996 Forbes      cover story on Berezovsky, threw new light on the doings of      Russia's oligarchs. The story grew into Klebnikov's first      book, with the same title, published in 2001. The exiled      industrialist took the magazine to court in London, and      eventually Forbes recanted accusations of violence. Those of      us who lived in Moscow during Berezovsky's heyday still      believe.       His follow-up stories on Russian industrialists were always      fair and thorough, but he didn't make many friends in the      country. Soon after Vladimir Putin stepped into the      presidency, Klebnikov and I met in New York. I told him he      needed to watch his back with so much change afoot. He      shrugged and said he was uniquely positioned to get to the      heart of corruption in Russia. ``Who else is going to do      it?'' he asked. I had no answer.       When Forbes announced Klebnikov would lead its new Russian      publication and relocate to Moscow, I immediately feared for      his safety. A few months later he was dead. I think about      him, sprawled bleeding on the sidewalk, coughing his final      words to a reporter colleague who found him dying.       Russia hasn't changed in the past decade and at this      trajectory it won't be truly civilized for generations. Those      who killed Klebnikov are killing today, plan to kill      tomorrow, and know they'll roam free to kill for years to      come. Hellbent on getting rich, they have no boundaries.      Raised in a communist world devoid of morals, they have no      soul.       There is no valid reason why a nation so tolerant--even      complicit--in organized crime should stand on par with world      leaders in groups such as the World Trade Organization. Putin      must stand as the guarantor of media freedom. And the Bush      administration must demand results in this murder      investigation and require the assassins and their bosses be      detected, arrested, tried and punished to the fullest extent      of the law.       Or will it let Paul Klebnikov, like Paul Tatum, be just      another footnote in Russia's disingenuous flirtation with      world-class rule of law? We're waiting."

By calling them bath salts, manufacturers are trying to deliberately mislead people into thinking they are an everyday product. It is despicable when young kids--14, 15, 16 years old--try bath salts and they think it is harmless. These dangerous drugs are sold in convenience stores and smoke shops for as little as $14 to $40. And what are their names? Tranquility, Zoom, White Lightning, and Hurricane Charlie. These so-called bath salts or plant foods are nothing more than deadly narcotics, and they are being sold cheaply to all comers with no questions asked at store counters around the country. How is it possible that such deadly drugs are legal? Because by marketing them as bath salts, which aren't for human consumption, they aren't regulated. These bath salts have much the same effects, according to users, as cocaine or ecstasy, but they are preferred because they are cheaper and more readily accessible. In fact, according to court papers obtained by the Staten Island Advance, one of our fine local papers in New York, a seller in Brooklyn boasted to a Federal agent that the bath salts would deliver a better high than cocaine."

   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012--Continued",Howard,McKeon,Republican,M,CALIFORNIA,589,"Dear Mr. Chairman: The legislation you have proposed to      update and clarify the Authorization for the Use of Military      Force (``AUMF''), passed in September 2001 in the wake of the      attacks on the United States that occurred that month, is      both timely and constructive.       Since its passage, the AUMF has not been updated to reflect      the evolving nature and origin of the Islamist threat against      this country. Indeed, there are organizations, including the      Pakistani Taliban, that are arguably not within its reach,      and although we have fought and detained thousands of enemy      fighters captured not only in Afghanistan and Iraq, but also      in Somalia, Yemen and Pakistan, and continue to detain      hundreds, the AUMF does not even refer to detention, let      alone prescribe standards for detention. As a result of this      inaction, we have simply allowed policy makers and judges to      improvise how we deal with the evolving terrorist threat and      how we treat those we encounter on the battlefield. The      increased use of remotely piloted aircraft--drones--has      allowed us to strike lethally, but because dead men tell no      tales and records destroyed in drone attacks cannot be      exploited, we may unconsciously be defaulting toward      strategies that do not allow us to act as effectively as we      might if we captured terrorists instead of killing them.       Your new legislation would not confer new powers, but      rather would add order and rationality to what has been an      improvisational exercise overseen by judges who do not have      the fact-finding resources of Congress, or the accountability      that comes from being responsible for protecting the national      security.       I cannot for the life of me understand the opposition to      this measure that is coming from people who profess to be      concerned with civil liberties and the rule of law, and yet      seem to prefer an improvisational arrangement that does not      make us face up to the fact that we are detaining people. If      anything, such a system creates the occasion for offloading      our detention responsibility to countries that will treat      detainees much less humanely than we would, or killing      instead of capturing, which can hardly be said to present a      humane alternative or one governed by legal principles.       I would welcome the opportunity to provide whatever help      and input I can.           Yours sincerely,                                               Michael B. Mukasey."

I can remember General Schwarzkopf coming to the committee and laying out the problems we had in Desert Storm, Desert Shield, in the intelligence area. He said, I want to be able to look over that battlefield and know what the enemy is doing. That led us to push forward UAVs like Predator, like Global Hawk. We also had problems with denial and deception. This time we did so much better out in the West controlling any opportunity they had to bring up Scud missiles, et cetera, et cetera."

George DeFilippi has had a fine career, including in his most recent role as Head, Congressional Support Branch in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller). I would like to share with you some highlights.   George DeFilippi graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1969. Following graduation, he honorably served his nation on active duty for the next 30 years spanning many key leadership positions. From 1986 to 1991, George was the Commanding Officer of the 23rd Tactical Air Support Unit out of Davis Monthan AFB, where he was responsible for consolidating the forward air control training for all Air Force and Marine Corps operational units.   His next assignment was to serve as the Commander/Air Liaison Officer with the U.S. Army (XVII Airborne Corps) and Republic of Korea's Third Army, leading a 250-person unit integrating aviation assets into army operations. From 1993 to 1999 George reported to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition  Technology) and was responsible for the oversight of a $4 billion tactical fighter and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle programs. He later went on to serve as the Chief of Staff within OUSD (AT) continuing to provide oversight for major defense acquisition programs.   Upon completing 30 years of active duty service within the United States Air Force, George retired from active duty but continued to serve his country through the civilian sector. From 1999-2010, he worked within the Cobham Life Support Division as well as Government Relations promoting life support products to the U.S. Armed Forces.   In 2010, George DeFilippi reported to his current assignment as Head, Congressional Support Branch, Navy Appropriations Matters Office where he helped the Department of the Navy achieve their financial and legislative goals. For five years, George DeFilippi has demonstrated exceptional leadership and foresight, engaging Members of the Appropriations Committee and its staff to provide information essential to resourcing the Navy for its role as the world's dominant sea power. In an increasingly difficult budget environment, George DeFilippi provided essential support in shepherding Navy budgets through the appropriations process. George served our nation with integrity, insight and dedication.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in saying thank you to George DeFilippi for his extraordinary dedication to duty and steadfast service to this country throughout his distinguished career in the United States Air Force as well as his public service and we wish him and his wife Patricia the very best in his well-deserved retirement."

The overseas contingency operation funds are specifically for Iraq and Afghanistan. Both of the bills cut the Iraq security force funding by $500 million. They also shift funding for nine F-18 Hornets from base to the overseas contingency operations, despite the fact that we have not lost an F-18, and that is $500 million. It shifts $500 million in funding for UAVs from the base, where they were properly requested, to OCO. They should not be designated to overseas contingency operations. They fund 20 additional missile defense interceptors for $190 million, and they include more than $37 million in funding support for the southwest border for the National Guard. I strongly support funding for the southwest border--to have it secured--and I will continue to advocate for that, but it doesn't apply to overseas contingency operations."

The following year, the Toronto responded to a distress call of a sinking fishing boat while conducting work-ups off the Nova Scotia coast and rescued three crew members in an accident that claimed one life. In 2001-02, the Toronto deployed in the eastern Mediterranean with NATO's Standing Naval Force Atlantic, and later to the northern Arabian Sea in international security operations. In 2003, the Toronto participated in Operation Splinter, aiding in the clean-up and restoration of Halifax following the devastation of Hurricane Juan. Last year, the Toronto returned to the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Oman, and the Arabian Gulf as Canada's contribution to the global war on terrorism."

Senate Republicans used to insist that the filibustering of judicial nominations was unconstitutional. The Constitution has not changed but as soon as President Obama was elected they reversed course and filibustered President Obama's very first judicial nomination. Judge David Hamilton of Indiana was a widely-respected 15-year veteran of the Federal bench nominated to the Seventh Circuit and was supported by Senator Dick Lugar, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate. They delayed his confirmation for 7 months. Senate Republicans then proceeded to obstruct and delay just about every circuit court nominee of this President, filibustering 10 of them. They delayed confirmation of Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit for 11 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Jane Stranch of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit for 10 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Ray Lohier of New York to the Second Circuit for 7 months.

As in the case of Harzi, as demonstrated, this approach is fraught with diplomatic roadblocks, costing critical time in getting information from suspects to track terrorist networks. Perhaps that is why President Obama so often opts to use lethal drone strikes to kill terrorists, knowing that the U.S. would be unable to get access to interrogate these terror suspects by working through host governments or because he no longer has a way to detain them in U.S. custody short of providing them the full privileges of an article III court."

A day earlier, in Lahore, a college student asked Clinton why every student who visits the U.S. is viewed as a terrorist. The opinions Clinton heard weren't described in voices of radical clerics or politicians with anti-U.S. agendas.

8ec4767191ca204edc15fcdc5c314c1e,2015-12-17,PRESIDENTIAL STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIL,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Kabul, Afghanistan.--Supporters of the Islamic State group      in Afghanistan are attempting to establish a regional base in      the eastern city of Jalalabad, the commander of U.S. and NATO      forces in Afghanistan, General John Campbell, said on      Tuesday.       In an interview with The Associated Press, Campbell said      that ``foreign fighters'' from Syria and Iraq had joined      Afghans who had declared loyalty to the group in the eastern      province of Nangarhar, bordering Pakistan.       He said there were also ``indications'' that the IS      supporters in Nangarhar were trying to consolidate links with      the group's leadership in Syria and Iraq.       The Islamic State group controls about a third of Iraq and      Syria. Fighters loyal to the group in Afghanistan include      disaffected Afghan and Pakistani Taliban who have fought      fierce battles with the Taliban in recent months.       Afghan officials have said that IS supporters control a      number of border districts in Nangarhar and have a presence      in some other southern provinces, including Zabul and Ghazni.       Until now, however, it was unclear whether loyalists in      Afghanistan had institutional links to the group's      leadership.       Many of those who had declared allegiance to IS were      ``disenfranchised Taliban'' from both sides of the border,      Campbell said. But, he added, ``they've been reaching out.      I'm sure there are folks who have come from Syria and Iraq--I      couldn't tell you how many but there are indications of some      foreign fighters coming in there.       ``But they don't have the capability right now to attack      Europe, or attack the homeland, the United States. But that's      what they want to do, they've said that's what they want to      do,'' he said.       During the summer months, Taliban and IS loyalists fought      fierce battles in the far eastern districts of Nangarhar,      with residents reporting a range of atrocities, including      arbitrary imprisonment, forced marriages for young women, and      beheadings.       The IS loyalists have said they want to absorb Afghanistan      into a larger province of its ``caliphate'' called Khorasan.      Campbell said the group wants to establish a base in      Nangarhar's provincial capital, Jalalabad ``as the base of      the Khorasan province'' and ``work their way up into Kunar''      province immediately north.       The first credible reports of an IS presence in Afghanistan      emerged earlier this year in northern Helmand, though      recruiters believed to have had links to the leadership in      Syria were killed by U.S. drone strikes in February.       The presence in Nangarhar became clear in the summer, when      IS loyalists launched battles against the Taliban in the      border regions. For months, the Afghan forces--occupied with      fighting elsewhere--had let the two groups fight each other,      Campbell said. ``If the Taliban and ISIL want to kill each      other, let them do it,'' he said, using an alternative      acronym for the Islamic State group.       He said that control of the four districts--Achin, Nazyan,      Bati Kot and Spin Gar--had seesawed between the two groups.       The revelation in July that the Taliban's founder and      leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar had been dead for more than two      years has led to deep fissures in the leadership, and      infighting between rival Taliban factions that Campbell said      had left hundreds dead.       Campbell, who took control of U.S. and NATO forces in      Afghanistan in mid-2014, said splits among the Taliban, who      have been trying to overthrow the Afghan government since      their regime was driven from power in 2001 by the U.S.      invasion, could make the fight even harder in 2016.       ``The prize really is Kandahar, that's their strategic      goal,'' he said, referring to the southern province from      where the Taliban emerged after Afghanistan's vicious civil      war ended in 1996.       Neighboring Helmand province, where most of the world's      opium is produced, is currently the scene of fierce battles      for control of strategically important districts, including      Marjah.       Taliban fighters took control of the northern city of      Kunduz in September, for just three days before the Afghan      military, backed by U.S. forces, pushed them out.       Campbell said he did not believe the Taliban had planned to      hold or govern Kunduz, but the psychological impact of the      city's fall had been enormous. Jalalabad, he said, ``is not      going to fall.''       Afghan forces, ``challenged in many areas, understand the      impact of Kunduz,'' he said. ``I think they will make the      right adjustments so that it (Jalalabad) doesn't become      another Kunduz.''"

The stakes and risks are just too high and the brutal track record of Saddam is clear.   And clearly, as demonstrated recently by David Kay's interim report, we have seen unequivocally, that Saddam remained a danger to the world up to the last day of his regime.   Mr. Kay stated ``his WMD programs spanned more than two decades, involved thousands of people, billions of dollars''--(billions of dollars, I might add, that belonged to the Iraqi people and should have been reinvested in Iraq's infrastructure) ``and was elaborately shielded by security and deception operations that continued even beyond the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom.''   For months after the passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441, Saddam Hussein continued to violate his obligations to the international community by filing false declarations deceiving the inspectors and terrorizing the Iraqi People.   Mr. Kay stated in his interim report that dozens of WMD-related program activities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed from the U.N. during the inspections in late 2002 were discovered. According to his report, the discovery of these concealment efforts were learned primarily through the admission of Iraqi scientists and officials. Some of the examples he cited were:   A clandestine network of laboratories and safehouses within the Iraqi intelligence service existed that contained equipment subject to U.N. monitoring and suitable for continuing CBW research;   A prison laboratory complex, possibly used in human testing of BW agents, that Iraqi officials working to prepare for U.N. inspections were explicitly ordered not to declare to the U.N.

One particularly egregious provision is so broadly drafted that it could create a wholesale carveout of the Department of Defense from our Nation's transparency and accountability regime. If enacted into law, this could empower the Pentagon to withhold a nearly limitless amount of information from the American public. For example, the Pentagon could withhold the legal justifications for drone strikes against U.S. citizens, preventing the American people from knowing the legal basis upon which their government can employ lethal force against them. It could withhold from disclosure documents memorializing civilian killings by U.S. forces, depriving the American people of knowledge about the human cost of wars fought in their name. And if enacted, the Pentagon could withhold information about sexual assaults in the military, masking the true extent of sexual violence against soldiers who risk their lives defending our country. I will continue to oppose inclusion of this provision in the final NDAA."

The change from musket to rifle, from horse to motorized vehicle, from aircraft to missiles has in the past 230 years demonstrated the resolve of our Army and its leaders to adapt in the face of change. New units of action, enhanced global mobility, infusion of precision weapons, and the responsiveness found in Army UAVs along with real-time sharing of intelligence and information are the hallmarks of the U.S. Army today. What will never change is the courage, determination, and professionalism of the ultimate weapon in the Nation's arsenal: the American soldier."

The laser weapons system is under development as a rapid prototype to serve as an adjunct laser weapon for the Navy's Close-In-Weapon System to counter rockets, artillery, mortar and unmanned aerial vehicles for ship and expeditionary base defense. The $5 million requested for FY09 would accelerate development of this program by two years. The Navy's Joint Vision 2020 outlined an objective to develop directed energy weapons that provide unique capability against emerging asymmetric threats. Directed energy and laser weapon systems research and development, including high power free electron and high brightness electron laser technology, is consistent with this objective. This request is consistent with the intended and authorized purpose of the U.S. Department of the Navy Research and Development account. 'there is no matching requirement.

A leader in developing United States policy to respond to      terrorist attack, and an internationally recognized voice for      freedom,       Dr. Wolfowitz contributed to the intellectual framework for      operations in Afghanistan and Iraq that removed two brutally      oppressive regimes that encouraged and gave sanctuary to      terrorists. Fifty million people are now free from the bonds      of tyranny. Self-government is on the march in countries once      believed beyond freedom's reach. And Afghanistan and Iraq      have become our newest allies in the war on terror.       While addressing these sizable challenges, Dr. Wolfowitz      was a driving force in addressing President Bush's charge to      transform the Department of Defense to better fit the      challenges of the 21st century. He encouraged a culture of      planning that stresses innovation and supports intelligent      risk in areas ranging from defense organization to technology      development and training.       And Dr. Wolfowitz is a tireless advocate for America's men      and women in uniform. A frequent visitor to wounded forces      and their families in hospitals and rehabilitation centers,      he paid particular attention to the needs and concerns that      went beyond the typically excellent care they receive. Dr.      Wolfowitz oversaw the creation of a 24-hour operations center      to reduce bureaucratic procedures for the severely injured,      significantly improving the flow of information to ease their      burdens during recovery.       Dr. Wolfowitz's countless achievements reflect his keen      intellect, management acumen, vision and compassion.       Through his dedication to the pursuit of policies of      freedom and transformation, Dr. Wolfowitz contributed greatly      to the work of the Department of Defense and the United      States. The distinctive accomplishments of Dr. Wolfowitz      reflect great credit upon himself, the Department of Defense,      and the United States of America.       Dr. Wolfowitz has also received the Decoration for      Distinguished Civilian Service from the secretary of the      Army, the Distinguished Public Service Award from the      secretary of the Navy, and the Decoration for Exceptional      Civilian Service from the acting secretary of the Air Force.       Gen. Pace. Secretary Rumsfeld, Mrs. Rumsfeld, Senator      Warner, Senator Coleman, assembled leadership of the      Department of Defense, special guests and friends, and      especially to our wounded servicemembers who are here today.       It is my distinct honor and privilege to stand here      representing our Chairman, General Dick Myers, and all the      men and women who are proud to wear the uniform of the United      States Armed Forces to say farewell and thank you, Mr.      Secretary, for all you've done for all of us in uniform      during your tenure as our deputy secretary of Defense.       It's been my great honor and privilege, Secretary      Wolfowitz, to have known you and worked with you for the last      three-and-a-half years, and in that time, I think I've gotten      to know a little bit about the man.       You have great humility. Of all the titles that you have      earned--doctor, professor, dean, ambassador, secretary--the      two you prefer most are Dad and Paul. That says a lot about      you.       You're a man of great intellect. Put simply, you work hard      and you're smart. And you make those of us who work with you      feel good about our contributions, and you elicit from us our      very best recommendations, because you are, in fact, a      facilitator and a person who values the judgment of others--     and for that, we thank you.       You're also a man of great courage. Those of us who wear      the uniform understand courage on the battlefield, but      there's another very distinct form of courage, and that is      intellectual courage. Many times it has been my great      pleasure to watch you, when conversations have been going in      a particular direction, and someone would turn to you and      say, ``Don't you agree, Paul?'' And you would say, ``No, I      don't.'' And then you'd explain why you didn't in a very,      very well-reasoned, articulate way that although did not      always carry the day, certainly made everybody in that room      understand that you were part of this process, and that you      were going to speak your mind as you knew it should be      spoken, and benefit all of us in uniform by always speaking      the truth, as you knew it.       You're also a man of compassion. If I speak too much about      this, I will blow your cover. But the fact is that many, many      times in the halls of this building, you have said to me,      ``Pete, Sergeant so-and-so--or Lieutenant so-and-so, or      General so-and-so--has a problem, and I think if you say      something to him, or you look into this, it will make life      better for him.'' Certainly, all that you have done for the      wounded, both in your official capacity, but also as a human      being in your visits to the hospitals, in your caring for the      families, in your attendance at funerals, in your caring for      the families of the fallen.       In all those ways, Mr. Secretary, you have shown enormous      compassion. And for that, we are grateful. We will miss you,      but we know that there are millions of people around this      world who are now going to benefit from the intellect,      strength and compassion of Paul Wolfowitz as you go to lead      the World Bank.       It is my great honor now to introduce the man in this      building who works harder than anybody else, has more focus      than anybody else, and makes the rest of us work very, very      hard, very diligently, to be part of the team that is trying      to do for this country all that we should be doing.       Mr. Secretary: Secretary Rumsfeld.       Sec. Rumsfeld. Well, thank you all for coming. We're      pleased you're here. A special welcome to Paul Wolfowitz and      his family and friends and lovely daughter, Rachel, sitting      there. And welcome to Chairman John Warner. We appreciate      your being here, your old stomping grounds. And Senator      Coleman, thank you so much for being here, and all the senior      military and civilian officials of the Department of Defense      and guests. Welcome.       Three years ago, The Economist magazine had an interesting      take on the job of deputy Cabinet secretary. It wrote, ``Most      deputy secretaries live lives of quiet frustration. They get      stuck with all the grunt work, while their bosses swan around      in the limelight. And they have to sit mutely while the      best ideas are either buried or stolen.'' And then there's      Paul Wolfowitz. (Laughter.)       History is not always generous to the men and women who      help to shape it. Great abolitionists like John Quincy Adams      and Frederick Douglas would not live to see full equality for      African Americans that they had envisioned and fought to      bring about. Many brave East Germans were shot as they tried      to breach the Berlin Wall and would never see the wall      crumble under the weight of lies and pretensions that built      it. But sometimes history is kind, and it gave President      Harry Truman, for example, and George Marshall the chance to      see the fall of the Third Reich and the fulfillment of their      charge to rebuild Western Europe.       And it allowed Corazon Aquino, with the help from a young      assistant secretary of State, Paul Wolfowitz, to see the      triumph of people power in the Philippines, the dream her      husband had nurtured and for which he was cut down before it      was fulfilled.       And although it may not always have seemed to Paul, the      fact is history has smiled on Paul, as it should.       So he leaves us today with the good fortune of seeing so      much accomplished--or being accomplished, I should say--he      helped bring to fruition or things that he helped set in      motion: reform and the modernizing of America's defense      establishment, the dispatch of dangerous regimes in      Afghanistan and Iraq, the spark of freedom and self-     government that is finding oxygen in the Middle East.       Paul now will add one more title to all the titles that      Pete Pace listed, and it's a heady list. When I stood with      Paul at his welcoming ceremony at the Pentagon way back in      2001, more than four years ago--it seems like eight--     (laughter)--I noted that this was Paul's third tour in the      Department of Defense. I told him we were going to keep      bringing him back until he got it right.       Well, he got it right this time. The activities he has been      involved with over the past four years are extensive. He has      helped craft four defense budgets and supplementals. He has      helped bring new technologies to protect our troops. And he      has helped to reconfigure a number of Cold War systems and      organizations to help us meet the threats of the 21st      century.       So as we bid Paul a warm farewell, I might just say a word      or two about the Paul Wolfowitz that I have worked with these      past four years. They say in life people tend to fall into      one of two categories--dreamers and doers. Well, our friend      Paul is a bit of a ``mugwamp,'' as they used to say in the      old days; he's a bit of both, one who lives the creed that      ``think as a man of action and act as a man of thought''.       He grew up in Brooklyn in a household of Polish immigrants      for whom names like Hitler and Stalin and words like      holocaust were not abstractions or simply pages in a history      book. And it should be no surprise to those who know him that      one of Paul's early political acts--at the age of 19, I'm      told--was to participate in the March for Civil Rights with      Dr. Martin Luther King.       Paul was a bright young mathematician who drifted into      political science, undoubtedly disappointing his father, who      I am told would have preferred he pursue a career in a real      subject, like chemistry or something like that. But Paul's      analytic talents have been put to excellent use as someone      who has grasped future trends and threats before many were      able to and before some probably wanted to.       As early as the 1960s, he foresaw the dangers of nuclear      weapon programs in the Middle East In the 1970s he identified      the territorial ambitions of Iraq as a future concern for the      U.S. military. And before September 11th, he grasped that the      civilized world could not make a separate peace with      terrorists and that our future security was certainly linked      to addressing the freedom deficit in much of the Muslim      world.       History will see Paul as one of the consequential thinkers      and public servants of his generation. He's worked to ease      the burdens of the wounded and their families, as we've seen.      And he's departing the Pentagon now, but the legacy that Paul      has been a part of, the ideas he has helped to weave into      public and private debates, the effects of the policies that      he's championed so effectively and with such courage and      determination are not going anywhere, because they're not      found only in this building or only in the department all      across the globe; they are found now in towns and villages in      Indonesia, where I'm told that pictures still hang in tribute      to an American ambassador who put the aspirations of      dissidents and ordinary Indonesians above the temporary      convenience of power politics.       They're found in Afghanistan today, where a democratically      elected government now protects women and imprisons      terrorists, instead of imprisoning women and harboring      terrorists. And they're found in a schoolroom in Iraq, where      a young girl will learn real history and real subjects      instead of lies and tributes to tyrants.       That girl is free, and so are millions like her--and that,      in part, is because of you, Paul. You've been on their side.      And as General Pace said, you have never wavered. The      threatened, the oppressed and the persecuted around the world      must know in their heart that they have had a friend in Paul      Wolfowitz. You are one of those rare people who, as the      Talmud puts it, would rather light candles than curse the      darkness.       So I thank you, your country thanks you, and on behalf of      the Department of Defense, we wish you Godspeed in your new      post, a post of service to the world. The department will      miss one of its finest public servants, and I will miss a      treasured friend. Godspeed.       Staff: Ladies and gentlemen, Deputy Secretary Paul      Wolfowitz.       Mr. Wolfowitz. Thank you all for coming today.       Thank you for braving the weather. Thank you, all of you      who helped arrange the weather so that we could stay      outdoors. I appreciate it enormously.       Senator Warner, great chairman of our Armed Services      Committee and a good friend all these many years, and      particularly the last four years, thank you for being here.      Senator Coleman, and so many distinguished guests. You really      do me honor to be here.       Secretary Rumsfeld, thank you for those extremely generous      remarks. Thank you for an award, which recognizes me, but      actually recognizes the work of literally millions of great      Americans. Your remarks call to mind something that President      Johnson said on a similar occasion many years ago when he      said he wished that his late parents could have been alive to      hear that introduction because his father would have been so      proud, and his mother would have believed it. (Chuckles.)      (Laughter.)       Maybe now is the time to come clean and to thank you for      something else. For four years now, I've been      telling audiences about what you said about keeping--     bringing me back until I got it right. It gets a laugh      every time. So I want to thank you for that great line.      It's been good to me all those years.       And now I'd like to just turn the tables a little bit and      trade a story somewhat along the same lines. It may be      apocryphal, but it's just too good to check whether it's true      or not. It's about how Don Rumsfeld once asked Henry      Kissinger if he was planning to come back as secretary of      State. And Kissinger said, ``No, Don, I got it right the      first time.'' (Laughter.)       So, Don, it looks like we've been in the same boat all      along!       Truthfully, Don Rumsfeld has a great sense of humor, that's      why I can tease him a bit too. And he's known for many other      things: His determination, his forcefulness, his command of      the podium, his charm, his matinee idol good looks--yes, he's      one of the stars of C-SPAN!       But to be totally serious, what really stands out for me is      something that may not be widely known, and that is what a      great teacher Don Rumsfeld is. He has sharpened everybody's      thinking and raised everybody's standards. And he's taught me      an enormous amount. He encourages and cajoles everyone to do      better, always for the purpose of making this Defense      Department as good as it can be, and to make our country more      secure.       It's been my good fortune, Don, to have you as a friend,      and America's to have your steady leadership at this      demanding helm. Thank you.       I also want to say thank you to so many of my wounded      veteran friends from Walter Reed and Bethesda who have braved      the weather to be here today. There are so many other      distinguished guests and friends and colleagues, that if I      tried to mention you all and give you the thanks you deserve,      I'd just get into deeper trouble. At a time like this, words      inevitably fall short, and I'm sure I'd leave someone out.      But you don't do a job like this without enormous amounts of      help.       So, to each one of you who has been there along the way,      just know that I am deeply grateful for what we've shared      during this most important chapter of American history.       And I'm particularly grateful to my personal staff, an      extraordinary combination of civilians and military, active      and reserve, officers and enlisted, who make a difference      every day.       Last Friday I was privileged to be present at the White      House when President Bush announced his nominee to be our      next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There in front of      me was an extraordinary team of civilian and military      leaders. First, there was our president, whom it's been such      an honor to serve. I've been privileged to be there as George      W. Bush has made some of the toughest decisions a leader can      make. I can tell you that this is a man who understands the      true costs of war, and his charge to defend what we hold most      dear. We are blessed in this time of testing to have a      president who possesses the deep moral courage to do what it      takes to protect our country.       Next to him was Secretary Rumsfeld, and there too was our      chairman, General Dick Myers. As we wage this global war,      Dick's been a leader of quiet, reassuring confidence; a rock      of strength and a source of steady judgment and deep concern      for those he serves. Dick never forgets that every decision      he makes directly affects the individual men and women who      serve this country so well.       And its been my good luck to have as my closest military      counterpart most of these past four years, General Peter      Pace, our vice chairman. It was a special moment last Friday,      Pete, to see you nominated to be the first Marine to serve as      chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. You have the      character, the commitment and the courage to do an      outstanding job as our top military leader.       I'm delighted, Gordon--that Gordon England, our secretary      of the Navy, who has been an outstanding member of this      civilian military leadership team, has agreed to take      on this challenging job--and it is challenging.       Over the last four years, I've had the privilege of working      with perhaps the finest group of Joint Chiefs and combatant      commanders that we've ever had. And our many outstanding one-      and two-star flag officers promise to continue or even exceed      that record of excellence.       But the people who have earned a truly special place in my      heart, in all of our hearts, are the men and women whose      names don't appear in the papers or on the evening news; the      ones who serve America quietly and professionally every day,      the men and women who wear this country's uniform, and the      dedicated civil servants who support them. They are the ones      who deserve our special and lasting gratitude. They are      represented here today by these magnificent troops and by our      wounded veterans. Please join me now in recognizing them for      their service.       And let us remember in a special way those who have fallen      in service to this nation. They remain in our hearts, each      one of them, a reminder that our country is blessed beyond      all measure. Let us never forget how much we owe them.       When terrorists attacked us so ruthlessly on September      11th, they may have thought they knew who we were. They may      have thought we were weak, grown used to comfort, softened by      everything we enjoy in this great nation. But they      were wrong. They must have failed to notice that it was by      the sweat and blood of each soldier, sailor, airman, and      Marine, and each member of the Coast Guard, that America      has met every threat throughout our history.       When we needed them, the heroes of this generation stepped      forward to defend America from terrorists. In the process,      two brutal regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq--regimes that      harbored and encouraged terrorists--have been removed from      power. And as a result, 50 million people, almost all of them      Muslims, have also been released from tyranny.       In a region where many thought freedom and self-government      could never succeed, those values are beginning to take hold.      The tide is turning against the terrorists' brand of      totalitarianism. Like Nazism and communism before them, this      false ideology is headed for the ash heap of history.       And at the same time that we are facing the enormous of      winning a global war, we've also advanced the president's      agenda for transforming the department. We've made major      adjustments in programs such as the Trident Submarine Force,      new classes of surface ships, unmanned aerial vehicles, Army      artillery and Army aviation, missile defense and      transformational communications across the department.       We've introduced a whole new civilian personnel system for      the department. And along the way, we've done four regular      budgets, four budget amendments, and at least six      supplementals. None of these decisions was easy; indeed, many      were difficult. But in no small measure, because of what      seemed, at times, like endless hours of meetings--and no,      Don, I'm not complaining--we managed to achieve agreement      between the senior civilian and military leadership of DoD.       Senator Ted Stevens paid tribute to that fact this past      week when he said, ``I've never seen such a relationship      between chiefs and the secretary--open discussions, open      critique--and really, a give and take that was very helpful      and very healthy as far as the department is concerned.''       However, as important as these programmatic decisions have      been, transformation is most of all about new ways of      thinking; about how to use old systems in new ways. During      the last four years, the concepts of transformation and      asymmetric warfare have gone from being theoretical concepts      to battlefield realities, and are even penetrating our vast      acquisition apparatus, from the bureaucracy, to industry, to      Congress.       But I don't have to tell this audience that all our      marvelous machines and technology would mean nothing without      innovative and skillful people to employ them.       And even then, this department would be of little value if      our people lacked one particular quality. It's the      indispensable quality and the most precious one of all, human      courage. In this job, which has been so much more than a job      to me, I've seen courage in abundance.       I remember the valor of an Army sergeant named Steve      Workman. In the desperate moments after Flight 77 slammed      into these walls, he risked his life to get Navy Lieutenant      Kevin Shaeffer out of the building and to the medical      attention he desperately needed. Sergeant Workman stayed with      the badly wounded--burned officer and kept him talking and      kept him alive.       I'll remember the bravery of people like Corporal Eddie      Wright, a Marine who was hit by an RPG that ruptured his      eardrum, broke his femur and, most seriously, blew off both      his hands. In the confusion, Marines who had never seen      combat before needed reassurance, and it was Eddie Wright, as      badly wounded as he was, who gave it to them, telling them he      was fine, giving instructions on his own first aid, pointing      out enemy positions while directing his driver to get them      out of the ambush zone. Like so many of our wounded heroes,      Eddie's moving on in life with the same courage that he      summoned in those desperate moments in Iraq.       And I remember October 26, 2003, the day our hotel in      Baghdad, the AI-Rashid, was attacked. Tragically, a great      soldier, Lieutenant Colonel Chad Buehring, was killed that      day, and five others, civilian and military, were severely      wounded.       Visiting the hospital that afternoon, I spoke to an Army      colonel who was the most severely wounded. I asked him where      he was from, and he said, ``I live in Arlington, Virginia,      but I grew up in Lebanon, in Beirut.'' So I asked him how he      felt about building a new Middle East. He gave me a thumbs-     up, and despite his obvious pain, he also gave me a smile.      Today Colonel Elias Nimmer is now virtually recovered and      still on active duty with the U.S. Army.       But courage comes in many forms. Sometimes moral courage,      the courage to face criticism and challenge-received wisdom      is as important as physical courage, and I see many examples      of that. One such hero I've been privileged to know is Navy      Medical Doctor Captain Marlene DeMaio. She was convinced that      there was a serious flaw in the way we were designing body      armor. In the face of considerable resistance and criticism,      she put together a team whose research proved the need to      modify the body armor design. She and her team took on the      bureaucracy and won. Her moral courage has saved countless      American lives in Afghanistan and in Iraq.       There are so many other stories I could share, but I will      tell you just one more. Three months ago, I attended a      funeral at Arlington for a soldier from St. Paul, Minnesota.      Sergeant Michael Carlson had been killed just before the      January 30th elections in Iraq. Not long after those historic      elections, I received a letter from his mother.       Mrs. Carlson wrote to tell me how much it meant to her to      see the joy on the faces of Iraqi voters, men and women who      had risked their lives for something they believed in. She      knew her son shared that same sort of vision, and she sent me      an essay that he had written as a high school senior that      explained how she could be certain of that. It's a remarkable      essay, particularly from such a young man.       Michael had been an outstanding high school football      player, but he didn't want to become a professional athlete.      He wrote, ``I want my life to count for something more than      just a game. I want to be good at life. I want to fight for      something, be part of something that is greater than myself.      The only way to live forever,'' this high school senior      wrote, ``is to live on in those you have affected. I      sometimes dream of being a soldier, helping to liberate      people from oppression. In the end,'' he said, ``there's a      monument built to immortalize us in stone.''       Men and women like that, men and women like Michael Carlson      do become immortalized because they live on in our nation's      soul.       President Reagan used to ask, where do we find such people?      And he would answer: We find them where we've always found      them, on the streets and the farms of America. They are the      product of the freest society man has ever known.       On one of my visits to Iraq, I met a brigade commander who      told me how he explained his mission to his men.

Now the president has asked me to take on a new mission      that of working on behalf of the world's poor. Although I      leave the Department of Defense, I believe both our missions      serve the goal of making this world a better place. It's an      honor. But I have one big regret: I'll be leaving some of the      most dedicated, most capable, most courageous people in the      world.       In many speeches over these years, I've been accustomed to      ask the good Lord to bless our troops and our country.

1899d205013e382939fa572271db55a8,2008-09-25,EARMARK DECLARATION,Robert,Aderholt,Republican,M,ALABAMA,100,"Description of Request: $1,600,000 to continue the work of qualification of M65 Bismaleimide resin for the F-22, F-35, Long Range Strike, UAV's and other future programs. Qualification consists of the generation of design allowable data that enables engineers to design aircraft. Labor and salaries will account for approximately 80 percent of the costs; materials 10-20 percent.The currently qualified BMI system on the F-22 and F-35 is a very low viscosity resin that exhibits a high percentage of resin flow during cure. This high resin flow results in excessive variability in the thickness of the cured structure. To account for this, parts manufacture either adds excess material and machine to final thickness or add shims during the assembly process. In some cases, a structure will be assembled and disassembled three or more times to achieve the desired tolerances. M65 is a controlled flow resin that does not exhibit high resin flow during cure. The controlled flow nature of M65 BMI resin will allow the manufacture of net thickness structures that will not need post manufacture, machining, or shimming. Other benefits of the system include faster processing rates using Advance Fiber Placement (AFP) and suitability for co-curing sandwich structures. The increase in fiber placement will reduce the number of man hours for parts manufacture as well as reduce the cost for new tooling. There would be significant cost reduction benefit from reduced assembly effort, increased processing speeds, longer out times, and simplified sandwich processing for current and future DOD aircraft programs. In addition, the elimination of shimming will result in reduced and consistent structural weight. Initial trials of the new M65 resin system have shown a 50 percent increase in the speed of part fabrication on the existing fiber placement machines. This could easily save $60-80M in equipment cost alone, plus it will reduce the cost of the F-35 and F-22 parts by approximately 40 percent. Additionally, the ability to return to the large one piece parts, like the F-35 upper wing skin, will create a significant weight savings, which the F-35 program desperately needs. Finally, material cost savings would be realized by introducing M65 as a competitive, second source. The impact of savings can be derived from the F-18 example where 40 percent material cost savings were realized. Given the national security significance, it is also important to maintain U.S. skills in this process."

                  CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS",James,McGovern,Democrat,M,MASSACHUSETTS,187,"House Republican Leader John Boehner, the Ohio Republican      with his eye on Speaker Nancy Pelosi's gavel, said the tide      is turning the GOP's way.       ``The American people have written off the Democrats,''      Boehner said Monday in an interview with Tribune-Review      editors and reporters. ``They're willing to look at us      again.''       Boehner stopped short of predicting Republicans would gain      the 39 seats they need to retake control of Congress, but he      said a backlash against President Obama's policies has      energized Republican voters more than Democrats. Boehner said      voters are angry at a government they believe is overreaching      and indifferent.       University of Virginia political scientist Isaac Wood said      excitement among tea party protesters might not carry over to      the electorate as a whole.       ``While the enthusiasm of tea party types may drive them to      the polls and boost Republicans, it does not yet seem that      huge waves of new voters will be flocking to the polls,''      Wood said.       Boehner said the protests are emblematic of deep voter      anger against Washington's leaders.       ``They're snuffing out the America that I grew up in,''      Boehner said. ``Right now, we've got more Americans engaged      in their government than at any time in our history. There's      a political rebellion brewing, and I don't think we've seen      anything like it since 1776.''       The health care law passed in March ``pushed most Americans      over the edge,'' Boehner said.       If Republicans retake control of the House, Boehner      promised a vote on a bill repealing the health care law and      replacing it with a scaled-down package of tax breaks and      court reforms. Democrats likely would maintain control of the      Senate, and Obama could veto the proposal, all but      eliminating its chances of succeeding.       ``We are going to do everything we can to make sure that      this law and this program never really takes effect,''      Boehner said. One option would be to repeal the $534 billion      in Medicare cuts, which pay for more than half of the law's      provisions. ``They're going to need money from the Congress      to hire these 20,000-plus bureaucrats they need to hire to      make this program work. They're not going to get one dime      from us.''       Boehner criticized the financial regulatory overhaul      compromise reached last week between House and Senate      negotiators as an overreaction to the financial crisis that      triggered the recession. The bill would tighten restrictions      on lending, create a consumer protection agency with broad      oversight power and give the government an orderly way to      dissolve the largest financial institutions if they run out      of money.       ``This is killing an ant with a nuclear weapon,'' Boehner      said. What's most needed is more transparency and better      enforcement by regulators, he said.       Allan H. Meltzer, a political economy professor at Carnegie      Mellon University, said the financial bill ``does nothing to      restore integrity to the mortgage market by correcting Fannie      Mae and Freddie Mac, and the bill does not eliminate `too big      to fail.' ''       Boehner said Obama overreacted to the BP oil spill in the      Gulf of Mexico. The spill might warrant a ``pause'' in      deepwater drilling, but Obama's blanket ban on drilling in      the gulf--which a judge overturned last week--could devastate      the region's economy, he said. Louisiana State University      scientists estimate the ban could have affected more than      10,000 jobs.       Boehner had praise, however, for Obama's troop surge in      Afghanistan and stepped-up drone attacks in Pakistan. He      declined to list any benchmarks he has for measuring progress      in the nine-year war, at a time of increasing violence and      Obama's replacement of Gen. Stanley McChrystal with Gen.      David Petraeus.       Ensuring there's enough money to pay for the war will      require reforming the country's entitlement system, Boehner      said. He said he'd favor increasing the Social Security      retirement age to 70 for people who have at least 20 years      until retirement, tying cost-of-living increases to the      consumer price index rather than wage inflation and limiting      payments to those who need them.       ``We need to look at the American people and explain to      them that we're broke,'' Boehner said. ``If you have      substantial non-Social Security income while you're retired,      why are we paying you at a time when we're broke? We just      need to be honest with people.''"

We are using drones all over the world to go after terrorists. We went inside Pakistan to kill bin Laden. Sometimes these drone attacks are designed to kill terrorists and unfortunately civilians are injured and sometimes killed. The United States is not intentionally trying to kill these civilians. We are not joining with a terrorist organization to kill innocent people. We are actually exercising national security discretion.

That fixes the problem we face as a nation. That would send a signal to the world that we are not opening a Pandora's box. It would allow the 9/11 families to move forward, but their burden would have to be that any government they sued knowingly engaged in activity with a terrorist who launched 9/11.

It is a weapon in the war against terror, but sometimes, as in war, mistakes were made and innocent civilians were killed along with those terrorists.

George Bush has staked      his credibility on the project; he has mid-term elections to      consider, oil supplies to secure and a flagging war on terror      to revive. Our voices are as little heeded in the White House      as the singing of the birds.       Our role is now, perhaps, confined to the modest but      necessary task of demonstrating the withdrawal of our      consent, while seeking to undermine the moral confidence      which could turn the attack on Iraq into a war against all      those states perceived to offend US strategic interests. No      task is more urgent than to expose the two astonishing lies      contained in George Bush's radio address on Saturday, namely      that ``the United States does not desire military conflict,      because we know the awful nature of war'' and ``we hope that      Iraq complies with the world's demands''. Mr. Bush appears to      have done everything in his power to prevent Iraq from      complying with the world's demands, while ensuring that      military conflict becomes inevitable.       On July 4 this year, Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of      the United Nations, began negotiating with Iraq over the      return of UN weapons inspectors. Iraq had resisted UN      inspections for three and a half years, but now it felt the      screw turning, and appeared to be on the point of      capitulation. On July 5, the Pentagon leaked its war plan to      the New York Times. The US, a Pentagon official revealed, was      preparing ``a major air campaign and land invasion'' to      ``topple President Saddam Hussein''. The talks immediately      collapsed.       Ten days ago, they were about to resume. Hans Blix, the      head of the UN inspections body, was due to meet Iraqi      officials in Vienna, to discuss the practicalities of re-     entering the country. The US Airforce launched bombing raids      on Basra, in southern Iraq, destroying a radar system. As the      Russian government pointed out, the attack could scarcely      have been better designed to scupper the talks. But this time      the Iraqis, mindful of the consequences of excluding he      inspectors, kept talking. Last Tuesday, they agreed to let      the UN back in. The State Department immediately announced,      with more candor than elegance, that it would ``go into      thwart mode''.       It wasn't bluffing. The following day, it leaked the draft      resolution on inspections it was placing before the UN      Security Council. This resembles nothing so much as a plan      for unopposed invasion. The decision about which sites should      be ``inspected'' would no longer be made buy the UN alone,      but also by ``any permanent member of the security council'',      such as the United States. The people inspecting these sites      could also be chosen by the US, and they would enjoy      ``unrestricted rights to free, unrestricted and immediate      movement'' within Iraq, ``including unrestricted access to      presidential sites''. They would be permitted to establish      ``regional bases and operating bases throughout Iraq'', where      they would be ``accompanied . . . by sufficient U.S.      security forces to protect them''. They would have the      right to declare exclusion zones, no-fly zones and      ``ground and air transit corridors''. They would be      allowed to fly and land as many planes, helicopters and      surveillance drones in Iraq as they want, to set up      ``encrypted communication'' networks and to seize ``any      equipment'' they choose to lay hands on.       The resolution, in other words, could not have failed to      remind Iraq of the alleged infiltration of the U.N. team in      1996. Both the Iraqi government and the former inspector      Scott Ritter maintain that the weapons inspectors were joined      that year by CIA covert operations specialists, who used the      U.N.'s special access to collect information and encourage      the republican guard to launch a coup. On Thursday, Britain      and the United States instructed the weapons inspectors not      to enter Iraq until the new resolution has been adopted.       As Milan Rai's new book War Plan Iraq documents, the U.S.      has been undermining disarmament for years. The U.N.'s      principal means of persuasion was paragraph 22 of the      security council's resolution 687, which promised that      economic sanctions would be lifted once Iraq ceased to      possess weapons of mass destruction. But in April 1994,      Warren Christopher, the U.S. secretary of state, unilaterally      withdrew this promise, removing Iraq's main incentive to      comply. Three years later his successor, Madeleine Albright,      insisted that sanctions would not be lifted while Saddam      remained in power.       The U.S. government maintains that Saddam Hussein expelled      the U.N. inspectors from Iraq in 1998, but this is not true.      On October 30, 1998, the U.N. rejected a new U.N. proposal by      again refusing to lift the oil embargo if Iraq disarmed. On      the following day, the Iraqi government announced that it      would cease to cooperate with the inspectors. In fact it      permitted them to continue working, and over the next six      weeks they completed around 300 operations.       On December 14, Richard Butler, the head of the inspection      team, published a curiously contradictory report. The body of      the report recorded that over the past month ``the majority      of the inspections of facilities and sites under the ongoing      monitoring system were carried out with Iraq's cooperation'',      but his well-publicized conclusion was that ``no progress''      has been made. Russia and China accused Butler of bias. On      December 15, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. warned him that      his team should leave Iraq for its own safety. Butler pulled      out, and on the following day the U.S. started bombing Iraq.       From that point on, Saddam Hussein refused to allow U.N.      inspectors to return. At the end of last year, Jose Bustani,      the head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical      Weapons, proposed a means of resolving the crisis. His      organization had not been involved in the messy business of      1998, so he offered to send in his own inspectors, and      complete the job the U.N. had almost finished. The U.S.      responded by demanding Bustani's dismissal.The other member      states agreed to depose him only after the United States      threatened to destroy the organization if he stayed. Now Hans      Blinx, the head of the new U.N. inspectorate, may also be      feeling the heat. On Tuesday he insisted that he would take      his orders only from the security council. On Thursday, after      an hour-long meeting with U.S. officials, he agreed with the      Americans that there should be no inspections until a new      resolution had been approved.       For the past eight years the U.S., with Britain's help,      appears to have been seeking to prevent a resolution of the      crisis in Iraq. It is almost as if Iraq has been kept on ice,      as a necessary enemy to be warmed up whenever the occasion      demands. Today, as the economy slides and Bin Laden's latest      mocking message suggests that the war on terrorism has so far      failed, an enemy which can be located and bombed is more      necessary than ever. A just war can be pursued only when all      peaceful means have been exhausted. In this case, the      peaceful means have been averted."

In an October 2002 report entitled ``Iraq's Weapons of Mass      Destruction Programs,'' the Central Intelligence Agency      reached these key judgments:       Iraq has continued its weapons of mass destruction (WMD)      programs in defiance of UN resolutions and restrictions. Iraq      has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with      ranges in excess of UN restrictions; if left unchecked, it      probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade.       Iraq hides large portions of its WMD efforts. Revelations      after the Gulf War starkly demonstrate the extensive efforts      undertaken by Iraq to deny the world information about its      programs.        Since inspections ended in 1998, Iraq has maintained its      chemical weapons efforts, energized its missile program, and      invested more heavily in biological weapons; most analysts      assess Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program.       Iraq's growing ability to sell oil illicitly increases      Baghdad's capabilities to finance WMD programs; annual      earnings in cash and goods have more than quadrupled.       Iraq largely has rebuilt missile and biological weapons      facilities damaged during Operation Desert Fox and has      expanded its chemical and biological infrastructure under the      cover of civilian production.       Baghdad has exceeded UN range limits of 150 km with its      ballistic missiles and is working with unmanned aerial      vehicles (UAVs), which allow for a more lethal means to      deliver biological and, less likely, chemical warfare agents.       Although Saddam probably does not yet have nuclear weapons      or sufficient material to make any, he remains intent on      acquiring them.       How quickly Iraq will obtain its first nuclear weapon      depends on when it acquires sufficient weapons-grade fissile      material.       If Baghdad acquires sufficient weapons-grade fissile      material from abroad, it could make a nuclear weapon within a      year.       Iraq has begun renewed production of chemical warfare      agents, probably including mustard, sarin, cyclosarin, and      VX. Its capability was reduced during United Nations      inspections and is probably more limited now than it was at      the time of the Gulf War, although VX production and agent      storage life probably have been improved.       Saddam probably has stocked a few hundred metric tons of      chemical weapon (CW) agents.       The Iraqis have experience in manufacturing CW bombs,      artillery rockets, and projectiles, and probably possess      chemical agents for ballistic missile warheads, including for      a limited number of covertly stored, extended-range Scuds.       All key aspects--R, production, and weaponization--of      Iraq's offensive biological weapon (BW) program are active      and most elements are larger and more advanced than they were      before the Gulf War.       Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating BW agents and is      capable of quickly producing and weaponizing a variety of      such agents, including anthrax, for delivery by bombs, Scud      missiles, aerial sprayers, and covert operatives, including      potentially against the U.S. Homeland.       Baghdad has established a large-scale, redundant, and      concealed BW agent production capability, which includes      mobile facilities; these facilities can evade detection, are      highly survivable, and can exceed the production rates Iraq      had prior to the Gulf War.       Iraq maintains a small missile force and several      development programs, including for an Unmanned Aerial      Vehicle (UAV) that most analysts believe probably is intended      to deliver biological warfare agents.       Gaps in Iraqi accounting to UNSCOM suggests that Saddam      retains a covert force of up to a few dozen Scud-variant      missiles with ranges of 650 to 900 km.       Iraq is deploying its new al-Samoud and Ababil-100 short-     range ballistic missiles, which are capable of flying beyond      the U.N.-authorized 150-km range limit.       Iraq's UAVs, especially if used for delivery of chemical      and biological warfare (CBW) agents, could threaten its      neighbors, U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, and the United      States if brought close to, or into, the U.S. Homeland.       Iraq is developing medium-range ballistic missile      capabilities, largely through foreign assistance in building      specialized facilities.       Iraq's effort to extend the reach of its ballistic missile      force is not limited to medium-range missiles capable of      striking its immediate neighbors. Iraq has pursued long-range      ballistic missiles in the past and has even tested a      rudimentary space launch vehicle (SLV).       In testimony before the Subcommittee on International      Security, Proliferation and Federal Services, Robert Walpole,      the National Intelligence Officer for Strategic and Nuclear      Programs stated, ``Iraq's goals of becoming the predominant      regional power, and its hostile relations with many of its      neighbors, are the key drivers behind Iraq's ballistic      missile program.''       According to the Department of Defense's report      ``Proliferation: Threat and Response,'' Iraq in December 1988      attempted to launch the Al Abid 3-stage space launch vehicle,      which used 5 Scud missiles clustered together as a first      stage.       The Intelligence Community's unclassified summary of the      ``National Intelligence Estimate on Foreign Missile      Developments and the Ballistic Missile Threat Through 2015''      states:       After observing North Korean missile development the past      few years, Iraq would be likely to pursue a three-stage Taepo      Dong-2 [TD-2] approach to a ICBM, or space-launched vehicle,      which would be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon-sized      payload to the United States.       Iraq could develop and test a Taepo Dong-2-type system      within about ten years of a decision to do so.       If Iraq could buy a TD-2 from North Korea, it could have a      launch capability within a year or two of a purchase.       It could develop and test a TD-1-type [Taepo Dong-1]      system, within a few years.       Iraq could attempt before 2015 to test a rudimentary long-     range missile based on its failed Al-Abid SLV . . .       If it acquired No Dongs from North Korea, it could test an      ICBM within a few years of acquisition by clustering and      staging the No Dongs--similar to the clustering of Scuds for      the Al-Abid SLV."

236dd75383cdca54fb38b86b579a9295,2000-05-08,WORLD BANK AIDS MARSHALL PLAN TRUST FUND ACT,Barbara,Lee,Democrat,F,CALIFORNIA,240,"Convinced that the global spread of AIDS is reaching      catastrophic dimensions, the Clinton administration has      formally designated the disease for the first time as a      threat to U.S. national security that could topple foreign      governments, touch off ethnic wars and undo decades of work      in building free-market democracies abroad.       The National Security Council, which has never before been      involved in combating an infectious disease, is directing a      rapid reassessment of the government's efforts. The new push      is reflected in the doubling of budget requests--to $254      million--to combat AIDS overseas and in the creation on Feb.      8 of a White House interagency working group. The group has      been instructed to ``develop a series of expanded initiatives      to drive the international efforts'' to combat the disease.       Top officials and some members of Congress contemplate much      higher spending levels. The urgency of addressing AIDS has      also touched off internal disputes over long-settled      positions on trade policy and on legal requirements that aid      contractors buy only American supplies.       The new effort--described by its architects as tardy and      not commensurate with the size of the crisis--was spurred      last year by U.S. intelligence reports that looked at the      pandemic's broadest consequences for foreign governments and      societies, particularly in Africa. A National Intelligence      Estimate prepared in January, representing consensus among      government analysts, projected that a quarter of southern      Africa's population is likely to die of AIDS and that the      number of people dying of the disease will rise for a decade      before there is much prospect of improvement. Based on      current trends, that disastrous course could be repeated,      perhaps exceeded, in south Asia and the former Soviet Union.       ``At least some of the hardest-hit countries, initially in      sub-Saharan Africa and later in other regions, will face a      demographic catastrophe'' over the next 20 years, the study      said. ``This will further impoverish the poor and often the      middle class and produce a huge and impoverished orphan      cohort unable to cope and vulnerable to exploitation and      radicalization.''       Dramatic declines in life expectancy, the study said, are      the strongest risk factor for ``revolutionary wars, ethnic      wars, genocides and disruptive regime transitions'' in the      developing world. Based on historical analysis of 75 factors      that tend to destabilize governments, the authors said the      social consequences of AIDS appear to have ``a particularly      strong correlation with the likelihood of state failure in      partial democracies.''       Another mobilizing factor is American politics. African      American leaders, such as former representative Ron Dellums      (D-Calif.) and Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Ill), have      adopted the cause of AIDS in Africa. Their interest is      converging with that of long-standing AIDS activists in the      United States and Europe, where the course of the epidemic      has been slowed by preventive efforts and life-saving      combinations of anti-retroviral drugs. They are angry at      policies that price those medicines beyond the reach of the      developing world.       In June, those activists disrupted Vice President Gore's      presidential campaign announcement in Carthage, Tenn., and      two other speeches that week--``blindsiding us completely,''      as one senior adviser put it. The activists, and several      senior Clinton administration officials, say that pressure      accelerated the White House's response.       There is no recent precedent for treating disease as a      security threat. So unfamiliar are public health agencies      with the apparatus of national defense that one early task      force meeting was delayed when co-chairwoman Sandra Thurman,      whose Office of National AIDS Policy is across the street      from the White House, could not find the Situation Room.       For all the stakes they now describe, Clinton      administration officials do not contemplate addressing them      on a scale associated with traditional security priorities.      Gore's national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, freely      acknowledged that the 2001 budget request of $254 million to      combat AIDS abroad--a sum surpassed, for example, by drone      aircraft in the Pentagon budget--provides ``resources that      are inadequate for the task.'' He called the work of the task      force ``an iterative process'' aimed at slowing the plague's      rate of increase and alleviating some of its effects. Before      this year, federal spending on AIDS overseas remained      relatively flat.       Other officials noted that the United States has endorsed      U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's declared five-year goal      of reducing the rate of new infections by 25 percent. That      falls close to the CIA's best-case, and least probable,      scenario. Because such a turn of events would demand      resources from U.S. allies and multinational bodies, the new      White House group has been instructed to ``develop a series      of expanded initiatives to drive the international efforts.''       Fuerth, a member of the ``principals committee'' that takes      up the most important foreign policy questions, told      representatives from 16 agencies on Feb. 8 that the panel      wanted a package of proposals for Clinton within several      weeks. The working group is scheduled to finish drafting its      proposals in May. Fuerth said the government is looking for      ``the kind of focus and coordination on this issue that we      normally strive for on national security issues.''       ``The numbers of people who are dying, the impact on      elites--like the army, the educated people, the teachers--is      quite severe,'' he said. ``In the end it was a kind of slow-     motion destruction of everything we were trying, in our      contact programs and our military-to-military programs, to      build up, and would affect the viability of these societies,      would affect the stability of the region. . . . In the world      that we're facing, the destiny of the continent of Africa      matters. And it isn't as if this disease is going to stay put      in sub-Saharan Africa.''       Twenty-three million people are infected in sub-Saharan      Africa, with new infections coming at the rate of roughly      5,000 a day, according to World Health Organization figures.      Of 13 million deaths to date, 11 million have been in sub-     Saharan Africa. In the developing world, the disease spreads      primarily through heterosexual contact.       The intelligence estimate portrays the pandemic as the bad      side of globalization. Accelerating trade and travel--along      with underlying conditions favorable to the disease--are      pushing much of Asia, and particularly India, toward ``a      dramatic increase in infectious disease deaths, largely      driven by the spread of HIV/AIDS,'' the intelligence report      said. ``By 2010, the region could surpass Africa in the      number of HIV infections.'' The number of infections now is      relatively low, but the growth rate is high and governments      have been slow to respond.       Infections are also growing rapidly, and largely unchecked,      in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The      intelligence estimate said this growth will ``challenge      democratic development and transitions and possibly      contribute to humaniarian emergencies and military conflicts      to which the United States may need to respond.'' The report      also anticipates that ``infectious disease-related trade      embargoes and restrictions on travel and immigration also      will cause frictions among and with key trading partners and      other selected states.''       ``The thing that's most staggering, and people are just      begnning to grasp, is that Africa is the tip of the      iceberg,'' Thurman said. ``We are just at the beginning of a      pandemic the likes of which we have not seen in this century,      and in the end will probably never have seen in history.''       Senior administration officials, some of them apparently      frustrated, said that the government does not dispute      estimates by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS      that it would take nearly $2 billion to fund adequate      prevention in Africa, and a like sum for treatment. What the      United States has been spending, by contrast, ``is a rounding      error for county budgets'' in Fairfax and Montgomery      counties, said one disgusted official.       ``I don't have a fantasy that we're going to go to the Hill      and get $5 billion to build Africa's health care      infrastructure,'' said one senior Africa policymaker. ``We're      trying to determine effective steps that need to be taken,      and can be taken, right now.''       After initial resistance from U.S. Trade Representative      Charlene Barshefsky, the government has agreed in principle      to encourage cheaper access to life-saving drugs by relaxing      hard-line positions that protect U.S. drugmakers'      intellectual property. Gore has said publicly that the United      States does not rule out the use by afflicted countries of      locally made or imported generics of drugs under patent by      American companies. Assistant Trade Representative Joseph      Papovich has written to the governments of Thailand and South      Africa with new formulas for resolving intellectual property      disputes on such medicines.       But several participants in the government effort said the      practical meaning of the change, if any, will have to be      decided at the Cabinet level or by Clinton personally. An      early test comes in May, when Barshefsky's office decides      whether South Africa should be removed from the ``watch      list'' of countries facing potential trade sanctions. South      Africa is on that list because it passed a law the United      States initially described as threatening to the intellectual      property of American drug manufacturers.       With the prospect of substantial new spending, agencies      ranging from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention      (CDC) and National Institutes of Health to the Labor      Department are fighting over the allocation of funds.      Undersecretary of State Frank Loy, meanwhile, is said by      participants to be resisting the emerging consensus that the      international AIDS effort should be centered in Thurman's      office.       The task force has also battled over proposals to amend the      Foreign Assistance Act, which requires all taxpayer-funded      aid to come from American suppliers. Public health agencies      want exceptions for condoms and AIDS test kits, which can be      acquired more      cheaply overseas. Congress willing, the task force is likely      to recommend that change.       The high-profile attention from the top is ``raising this      issue in ways that leaders [of afflicted nations] can't      ignore it,'' one White House official said. Richard C.      Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, used      his rotation as Security Council president in January to      declare a month on Africa. He made AIDS the subject of the      first Security Council meeting of 2000 and invited Gore to      speak. When Clinton traveled to India in March, he      successfully pressed the government to issue a joint      declaration on AIDS.       Pervading the recent U.S. effort is a strong sense among      participants of time misspent. The virulence of the pandemic      are accurately foreseen, and ``the United States didn't      exactly cover itself with glory,'' said one close adviser to      Clinton.       ``We saw it coming, and we didn't act as quickly as we      could have,'' said Helene D. Gayle, a physician who directs      AIDS prevention at the CDC. ``I'm not sure what that says      about how seriously we took it, how seriously we took lives      in Africa.''       Peter Piot, a virologist who heads the United Nations AIDS      efforts in Geneva, said ``the good news is that the U.S.      government is mobilizing. The bad news is that it took so      long. This is not a catastrophe that came out of the blue. It      has been clearly coming for at least 10 years.''       Asked about those comments, Thurman looked pained.       ``Oh yeah,'' she said softly. ``It's very late. But better      late than never. You rarely ever get a second chance in an      epidemic.''"

                     PAKISTAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION",Dennis,Kucinich,Democrat,M,OHIO,160,"Washington--U.S. Special Operations Forces have begun      venturing out with Pakistani forces on aid projects,      deepening the American role in the effort to defeat Islamist      militants in Pakistani territory that has been off limits to      U.S. ground troops.       The expansion of U.S. cooperation is significant given      Pakistan's deep aversion to      allowing foreign military forces on its territory. The      Special Operations teams join the aid missions only when      commanders determine there is relatively little security      risk, a senior U.S. military official said, in an effort to      avoid direct engagement that would call attention to U.S.      participation.       The U.S. troops are allowed to defend themselves and return      fire if attacked. But the official emphasized the joint      missions aren't supposed to be combat operations, and the      Americans often participate in civilian garb.       Pakistan has told the U.S. that troops need to keep a low      profile. ``Going out in the open, that has negative optics,      that is something we have to work out,'' said a Pakistani      official. ``This whole exercise could be counterproductive if      people see U.S. boots on the ground.''       Because of Pakistan's sensitivities, the U.S. role has      developed slowly. In June 2008, top U.S. military officials      announced 30 American troops would begin a military training      program in Pakistan, but it took four months for Pakistan to      allow the program to begin.       The first U.S. Special Operations Forces were restricted to      military classrooms and training bases. Pakistan has      gradually allowed more trainers into the country and allowed      the mission's scope to expand. Today, the U.S. has about 120      trainers in the country, and the program is set to expand      again with new joint missions to oversee small-scale      development projects aimed at winning over tribal leaders,      according to officials familiar with the plan.       Such aid projects are a pillar of the U.S.      counterinsurgency strategy, which the U.S. hopes to pass on      to the Pakistanis through the training missions.       U.S. military officials say if U.S. forces are able to help      projects such as repairing infrastructure, distributing seeds      and providing generators or solar panels, they can build      trust with the Pakistani military, and encourage them to      accept more training in the field.       ``You have to bring something to the dance,'' said the      senior military official. ``And the way to do it is to have      cash ready to do everything from force protection to other      things that will protect the population.''       Congressional leaders last month approved $10 million in      funding for the aid missions, which will focus reconstruction      projects in poor tribal areas that are off-limits to foreign      civilian aid workers.       The Pakistani government has warned the Pentagon that a      more visible U.S. military presence could undermine the      mission of pacifying the border region, which has provided a      haven for militants staging attacks in Pakistan as well as      Afghanistan.       The U.S. has already aroused local animosity with drone      strikes targeting militants in the tribal areas, though the      missile strikes have the tacit support of the Pakistani      government and often aid the Pakistani army's campaign      against the militants.       Providing money to U.S. troops to spend in communities they      are trying to protect has been a tactic used for years to      fight insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan.       The move to accompany Pakistani forces in the field is even      more significant, and repeats a pattern seen in the      Philippines during the Bush administration, when Army Green      Berets took a gradually more expansive role in Manila's fight      against the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf in the southern      islands of Mindanao.       There, the Green Berets started in a limited training role,      and their initial deployment unleashed a political backlash      against the Philippine president. But as the Philippine      military began to improve their counterinsurgency skills,      Special Operations Forces accompanied them on major      offensives throughout the southern part of the archipelago.       In Pakistan, the U.S. military helps train both the regular      military and the Frontier Corps, a force drawn from residents      of the tribal regions but led by Pakistani Army officers.       The senior military official said the U.S. Special      Operations Forces have developed a closer relationship with      the Frontier Corps, and go out into the field more frequently      with those units. ``The Frontier Corps are more accepting      partners,'' said the official.       For years the Frontier Corps was underfunded and struggled      to provide basic equipment for its soldiers. A U.S. effort to      help equip the force has made them more accepting of outside      help.       Traveling with the Frontier Corps is dangerous. In      February, three Army soldiers were killed in Pakistan's      Northwest Frontier Province when a roadside bomb detonated      near their convoy. The soldiers, assigned to train the      Frontier Corps, were traveling out of uniform to the opening      of a school that had been renovated with U.S. money.       The regular Pakistani military also operates in the tribal      areas of Pakistan, but they are less willing to go on      missions with U.S. forces off the base, in part because they      believe appearing to accept U.S. help will make them look      weak, the senior U.S. military official said. The Pakistani      official said the military simply doesn't need foreign help.       During the past two years, Pakistan has stepped up military      operations against the militant groups that operate in the      tribal areas. Although Washington has praised the Pakistani      offensives, Pentagon officials have said Pakistan's military      needs help winning support among tribal elders. If      successful, More interactive graphics and photos the joint      missions and projects may help the Pakistani military retain      control of areas in South Waziristan, the Swat valley and      other border regions they have cleared of militants.       In Pakistan, the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad will retain      final approval for all projects, according to Defense      officials. But congressional staffers briefed on the program      said the intent is to have Pakistani military forces hand out      any of the goods bought with the funding or pay any local      workers hired.       ``The goal is never to have a U.S. footprint on any of      these efforts,'' said a congressional staffer."

He knew Paul Tatum, the Oklahoma entrepreneur who ran      afoul of Moscow's mafia and was shot dead just a few hundred      yards from a hotel he had founded and had fought against      Mayor Yuri Luzhkov to control. After Tatum's murder. Hizzoner      promised swift justice. We're still waiting.        Tatum had led a loud life in Moscow. Klebnikov told me he      knew Tatum's battle with city ``authorities'' was never a      sound strategy for survival. The Tatum murder shook him, but      he was determined to go forward with what grew into a series      of articles exposing Russian corruption. After all, he was a      reporter, not a businessman.        As a journalist, Klebnikov was the real deal. He was based      in New York through the 1990s but had more contacts in Moscow      than most reporters on the ground full time.       During his frequent trips to the region he accomplished      more meetings before lunch than many of us could pull off in      a week.       Klebnikov listened as intently to the griping of a      pensioner as he did to the drone of politicians. He was quick      to the point, wasted no time, and drove to the center of his      story like a tank. Some thought he was bold, others thought      him brash, but everyone was reading.       ``Godfather of the Kremlin,'' his December 1996 Forbes      cover story on Berezovsky, threw new light on the doings of      Russia's oligarchs. The story grew into Klebnikov's first      book,      with the same title, published in 2001. The exiled      industrialist took the magazine to court in London, and      eventually Forbes recanted accusations of violence. Those of      us who lived in Moscow during Berezovsky's heyday still      believe.       His follow-up stories on Russian industrialists were always      fair and thorough, but he didn't make many friends in the      country. Soon after Vladimir Putin stepped into the      presidency, Klebnikov and I met in New York. I told him he      needed to watch his back with so much change afoot. He      shrugged and said he was uniquely positioned to get to the      heart of corruption in Russia. ``Who else is going to do      it?'' he asked. I had no answer.       When Forbes announced Klebnikov would lead its new Russian      publications and relocate to Moscow, I immediately feared for      his safety. A few months later he was dead. I think about      him, sprawled bleeding on the sidewalk, coughing his final      words to a reporter colleague who found him dying.       Russia hasn't changed in the past decade and at this      trajectory it won't be truly civilized for generations. Those      who killed Klebnikov are killing today, plan to kill      tomorrow, and know they'll roam free to kill for years to      come. Hellbent on getting rich, they have no boundaries.      Raised in a communist world devoid of morals, they have no      soul.       There is no valid reason why a nation so tolerant--even      complicit--in organized crime should stand on par with world      leaders in groups such as the World Trade Organization. Putin      must stand as the guarantor of media freedom. And the Bush      administration must demand results in this murder      investigation and require the assassins and their bosses be      detected, arrested, tried and punished to the fullest extent      of the law.       Or will it let Paul Klebnikov, like Paul Tatum, be just      another footnote in Russia's disingenuous flirtation with      world-class rule of law? We're waiting."

We have a couple UAVs here, unmanned aerial vehicles, one called the ScanEagle, the other is called the Predator. The Predator is better known. But so far the ScanEagle has flown in Iraq and Afghanistan about 150 flight hours. The Predator has flown about a half million flight hours in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of our helicopters, I think the H-60, generally we think of as the Black Hawk, but Black Hawks have flown 900,000 flight hours in Iraq and Afghanistan.

On September 30, 2015, the Simpson, which is the last active Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate, will be decommissioned and leave the active United States Navy fleet.   The Simpson is named for Rear Admiral Rodger W. Simpson (1898-1964), who was a distinguished officer during World War II. RADM Simpson was awarded the Navy Cross, Silver Star and Legion of Merit for rescuing and evacuating more than 7,500 Allied prisoners of war and civilians interned in Japanese concentration camps. The USS Simpson was commissioned on November 9, 1985.    From its first overseas deployment, the USS Simpson and her crew have distinguished themselves in combat. On April 18, 1988, along with two other navy ships, the Simpson responded to the Iranian mine attack on the USS Samuel B. Roberts by destroying an Iranian oil platform and sinking the Iranian Navy mission patrol combatant, Joshan.   Over her 30 years of service, the Simpson made 14 deployments. Her final deployment was for seven months to the U.S. 5th and 6th Fleet areas of operation in which she conducted theater security cooperation exercises. As in the past, the crew was called on to support various task forces and performed perfectly never missing an operational commitment. Every sailor made a difference every day. In addition, some of the newest technologies in the Navy were aboard, four Fire Scouts (MQ-8B) vertical takeoff and landing tactical unmanned aerial vehicles.   The crew on the last deployment was comprised of reservists as well as active duty individual augmented personnel with zero previous experience with UAV's. Despite the challenges, the officers aboard reported the crew achieved the highest ever recorded maintenance readiness and sortie completion rate of any Fire Scout deployment in the program's history.   The Simpson will be decommissioned but the friendships and camaraderie this ship established on its decks will last for ages. It is a pleasure and honor to represent the great men and women who serve in the 4th Congressional District of Florida and to see them successfully complete the mission of the USS Simpson. Their hard work and dedication contributes to the important missions of our Nation's defense and reiterates our community's importance as an anchor of national security."

Bartley distinguished himself by      heroism and courageous action as F-16CG flight lead, 18      Fighter Squadron, in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM.      Upon learning of a downed MH-47 helicopter, Lieutenant      Colonel Bartley departed assigned airspace to immediately      support the recovery of thirty-nine personnel on board.      Enroute to the site, Lieutenant Colonel Bartley established      deconfliction with two Unnammed Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and two      F-15Es near the crash site to provide maximum support to the      rescue effort. With the F-15Es out of ammunition, Lieutenant      Colonel Bartley immediately employed 20mm cannon fire to      neutralize the enemy troops that were directly firing upon      the survivors. He made two strafing runs with little regard      for his own safety into rapidly rising mountaineous terrain,      and directly in the face of the same small arms fire that      downed the helicopter. He then provided a rapid talk-on to      his wingman, who was experiencing radio problems, to suppress      the advancing enemy troops. His skill and determination      forced the enemy troops to stop the attack on the downed      helicopter crew and friendly forces and concentrate on      digging in for cover approximately 50 meters from the crashed      MH-47. After expending all 500 rounds of 20mm ammunition he      stayed with the Ground Forward Air Controller (GFAC) on the      radio while his wingman passed all critical information to      command and control assets and located the tanker. His      actions resulted in the flight's ability to maintain      continuous contact with the GFAC and continue to threaten the      advancing enemy forces for over two and a half hours. Upon      returning to the crash site, the GFAC reported that the      previously pinned down enemy had begun to close in on their      position again. After his wingman had verified from command      and control that no other airborne assets had 20mm or light      ordnance, Lieutenant Colonel Bartley informed the GFAC of the      impending danger and at the GFAC's request dropped 500 pound      bombs within 100 meters of the crash site in order to keep      the enemy forces at bay. Meanwhile, a second GFAC reported      two more critically wounded soldiers requiring immediate      evacuation. Lieutenant Colonel Bartley pinned down the enemy,      and directed his wingman to coordinate for the air      evacuation. He offered to escort the helicopters through the      area with numerous small arms threats and Rocket Propelled      Grenards. His quick thinking and superior coordination      allowed friendly forces to maintain a secure location in      extremely close proxmity to the impact points and undoubtedly      saved the lives of 21 uninjured survivors and 10 wounded in      the crash site, and enabled the safe recovery of all 39      Americans. The undaunted leadership, extreme heroism and      courageous actions of Lieutenant Colonel Bartley are      consistent with the highest traditions of the United States      Air Force."

d44f12ce415f80f1ccc3b04985a88dc7,2013-04-23,RADICAL ISLAM AND THE ``T'' WORD,Louie,Gohmert,Republican,M,TEXAS,620,"If your concern about the threat posed by the Tsarnaev      brothers is limited to assuring that they will never be in a      position to repeat their grisly acts, rest easy.       The elder, Tamerlan--apparently named for the 14th-century      Muslim conqueror famous for building pyramids of his victims'      skulls to commemorate his triumphs over infidels--is dead.      The younger, Dzhokhar, will stand trial when his wounds heal,      in a proceeding where the most likely uncertainty will be the      penalty. No doubt there will be some legal swordplay over his      interrogation by the FBI's High-Value Interrogation Group      without receiving Miranda warnings. But the only downside for      the government in that duel is that his statements may not be      used against him at trial. This is not much of a risk when      you consider the other available evidence, including photo      images of him at the scene of the bombings and his own      reported confession to the victim whose car he helped hijack      during last week's terror in Boston.       But if your concern is over the larger threat that inheres      in who the Tsarnaev brothers were and are, what they did, and      what they represent, then worry--a lot.       For starters, you can worry about how the High-Value      Interrogation Group, or HIG, will do its work. That unit was      finally put in place by the FBI after so-called ``underwear      bomber'' named Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to blow up the      airplane in which he was traveling as it flew over Detroit on      Christmas Day in 2009 and was advised of his Miranda rights.      The CIA interrogation program that might have handled the      interview had by then been dismantled by President Obama.       At the behest of such Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated groups      as the Council on American Islamic Relations and the Islamic      Society of North America and other self-proclaimed spokesmen      for American Muslims, the FBI has bowdlerized its training      materials to exclude references to militant Islamism. Does      this delicacy infect the FBI's interrogation group as well?       Will we see another performance like the Army's after-     action report following Major Nidal Hasan's rampage at Fort      Hood in November 2009, preceded by his shout ``allahu      akhbar''--a report that spoke nothing of militant Islam but      referred to the incident as ``workplace violence''? If tone      is set at the top, recall that the Army chief of staff at the      time said the most tragic result of Fort Hood would be if it      interfered with the Army's diversity program.       Presumably, the investigation into the Boston terror attack      will include inquiry into not only the immediate      circumstances of the crimes but also who funded Tamerlan      Tsarnaev's months-long sojourn abroad in 2012 and his      comfortable lifestyle. Did he have a support network? What      training did he, and perhaps his younger brother, receive in      the use of weapons? Where did the elder of the two learn to      make the suicide vest he reportedly wore? The investigation      should include, as well, a deep dive into Tamerlan's      radicalization, the Islamist references in the brothers'      social media communications, and the jihadist Web sites they      visited.       Will the investigation probe as well the FBI's own      questioning of Tamerlan 2 years ago at the behest of an      unspecified foreign government, presumably Russia, over his      involvement with jihadist Web sites and other activities?      Tamerlan Tsarnaev is the fifth person since 9/11 who has      participated in terror attacks after questioning by the FBI.      He was preceded by Nidal Hasan; drone casualty Anwar al-     Awlaki; Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad--born Carlos Leon      Bledsoe--who murdered an Army recruit in Little Rock in June      2009; and David Coleman Headley, who provided intelligence to      the perpetrators of the Mumbai massacre in 2008. That doesn't      count Abdulmutallab, who was the subject of warnings to the      CIA that he was a potential terrorist."

The      most extreme example came in the House version of the      National Defense Authorization Act, which rejected virtually      every cost-cutting measure put forward by the Pentagon, from      base closings to retiring unneeded weapons systems. If the      House's actions aren't reversed, they would bust the current      budget caps to the tune of $50 billion over the next five      years.       There was one place the House authorizers were willing to      cut way back: a program designed to help communities adjust      to defense downsizings. This is particularly ill-advised at a      time when the Pentagon budget has been set on a path to come      down from a war-time buildup that brought it to its highest      levels since World War II.       While modest by historical terms, the defense build-down      that is now underway will demand adjustments in the      unrealistic spending plans Congress continues to authorize      for the Pentagon. And the cuts that are coming will have      impacts in scores of communities across the country.       Since the 1970s a small office within the Pentagon, the      Office of Economic Adjustment, has offered planning grants      and technical assistance to help these communities develop      their own strategies to capitalize on existing economic      strengths and adjust to postwar economic conditions. Once      these strategies are in place, the OEA serves as a point of      contact for impacted communities in accessing resources from      other federal agencies to help with implementation of their      plans. Just this week Ohio, Michigan and Indiana received a      grant of more than $2.4 million to fund a regional Defense      Manufacturing Assistance Program to address the loss of 3,900      defense-related jobs in those three states since 2012.       Most members of Congress want to base their judgments on      Pentagon spending on what is needed to defend the country.      But they also need to show defense-dependent communities,      businesses and workers in their states and districts that      they are watching out for their interests. The OEA's programs      give them a way to judge procurement spending accounts on      their merits,      while attending to the economic needs of their constituents.       Supporting the OEA does not mean that members of Congress      don't care about the existing jobs base. It just means that      they want in addition to have a Plan B in place in the event      of decisions that reduce Pentagon-related activities in their      areas.       It's troubling to watch the House voting to slash the OEA,      while standing firm in supporting costly, unneeded sacred      cows like the F-35 combat aircraft. Even slightly slowing the      pace of the F-35 program would pay for the OEA's programs      many times over.       The F-35--the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program      ever undertaken is--a poster child of waste. Current cost      estimates for building and maintaining the plane: roughly      $1.4 trillion over its lifetime. It has more than doubled in      price since it went into development, and it has had numerous      high profile failures, from cracked wings to unresolved      software problems. It is likely to perform many of its      assigned tasks less effectively than current generation      aircraft. An Air Force far superior to any other should be in      no rush to build over 2,400 F-35s.       The F-35 merely tops the House's list of unnecessary      expenditures. It rejected plans to delay the refueling of an      aircraft carrier at a savings of over $800 million--more than      ten times the cut proposed for the OEA. It attempts to block      the closure of excess military bases, stop the administration      from reducing the size of the Army, and prevent the Air Force      from retiring the U-2 spy plane, even as it funds Global Hawk      drones to do the same job. And the list goes on.       The common thread in all of these actions is a state of      denial about the trends in Pentagon spending. It will come      down this year, and under current law it will stabilize at      levels considerably lower than what the Pentagon's overly      ambitious plans will cost.       Funding programs that will help communities make the      transition to more diversified economies that can weather      reductions in Pentagon spending will make it easier to craft      budgets that put security concerns above pork barrel      politics. When the House and Senate put together a final      Pentagon budget proposal later this year, funding for OEA's      crucial programs should be restored."

DARPA also helped develop the Internet, and built the small receivers that made the global positioning system data easily accessible--both have changed the ways our forces operate, and have also changed the lives of all Americans for the better. Entire industries have developed from early DARPA-funded research in core technologies such as material sciences, microelectronics, photonics, and information technology."

I flew on missions all over the world tracking Soviet nuclear submarines. I have some experience with being involved in missions where we had naval aviation assets, fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, working and communicating with naval ships, naval submarines, and not just in the United States but with our NATO allies. I will tell you, it is hard to do. We have different procedures and sometimes different languages, and it is difficult to coordinate our operations and our exercises. I think when you put together a coalition with 60 different nations and try to figure out how to work and coordinate what everybody is doing--some are providing air power, which is what we do. We have two carrier groups in this part of the world. One is over here in the Mediterranean Sea and the other is down here in the Persian Gulf. We are launching F-18s and F-16s off of those carriers, and we are still using B-52s, which are literally older than the P-3s I used to fly on in the Navy all those years ago. They are operating out of a variety of bases, including Qatar and other places, to do high-precision bombing against the ISIS forces. We are using drones and A-10 warthogs. We have a lot of air and naval assets, as well as others in the Air Force, and we have helicopters as well."

Many of us are familiar with what is called the Predator B, which the Air Force refers to as the Reaper. That is this airplane. The Predator B is used extensively and has been used extensively in the war theater in Afghanistan and in Iraq and in that region. It is an unmanned aerial vehicle, unmanned aerial aircraft without a pilot. The pilot sits on the ground someplace in a little thing that looks almost like a trailer house, and they are flying this aircraft. In some cases, the pilot is 6,000, 8,000 miles away from where the aircraft is, flying it at a duty station perhaps at a National Guard base or somewhere else."
