And those planes      that drop the bombs? The destroyers that carry the missiles?      They have pilots, captains, and crews. All humans. Even the      ``unmanned'' drones have human pilots, and the psychological      wear and tear on them is staggering. Planes take off from      airfields in foreign lands and from aircraft carriers, both      of which are staffed by thousands of American somebodies,      just like those destroyer ships. At every turn in a military      operation you will find people. Intel analysts, linguists,      flight crews, and cooks. Even war plans . . . rely on      thousands of people who will be pulled to a new duty, which      causes reshuffling far and wide in the military community.      And this, most definitely, affects our military families.",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

It said that OLC ``operates from the presumption that it should make its significant opinions fully and promptly available to the public. This presumption furthers the interests of Executive Branch transparency, thereby contributing to accountability and effective government, and promoting public confidence in the legality of government action.'' This presumption did not exist in the Bush administration; David Barron was responsible for establishing it as OLC policy. Given Barron's impressive record and his shift of OLC toward more transparency, it simply is wrong to oppose his nomination because a classified OLC opinion on drone strikes has not been made public yet, a decision that was not even his to make.",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

His parents, who raised him to hate America, came to America on student visas. They studied here and had Anwar al-Awlaki. They took him back to Yemen and taught him to hate America. He became so dangerous that even President Obama felt he had to order a strike on an American citizen, without his having had a trial, without due process. He felt he had to take him out with a drone because that American citizen--an American citizen only because his parents came here on visas--was too dangerous for them to do anything else.

The fact is we are going to use the best technology and the best strategy to make sure the resources our U.S. military has deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq and which have been tested along the southern border are available for border control, so that by virtue of radar, eyes in the sky, dirigibles, and unmanned aerial vehicles, a combination of these connected to the sensors on the ground will make sure the Border Patrol knows what is happening along the border when people try to cross and enter illegally.
