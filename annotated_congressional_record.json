The Soap Box Derby is a youth racing program that has run in the United States since 1934. Cars competing in the Soap Box Derby are unpowered and rely completely on gravity to accelerate. During its peak in the 1950s and 1960s, when automobile manufacturers were national sponsors and famous television and cinema stars made special guest appearances at these races, as many as 70,000 people throughout the United States gathered each August to cheer on hundreds of young participants.",

In 1946, San Diegan Gilbert Klecan became the first West Coast participant to win the All-American World Championship, which is held every July at Derby Downs in Akron, Ohio. In those years, it was not uncommon to have as many as 300 cars racing along 6th Avenue downhill from Laurel Street. In the early 1970s, after automobile manufacturers pulled their sponsorship, the derby gradually faded in many cities. However, in the early 1990s the Kiwanis Club of San Diego Harbor and the Kiwanis Club of San Diego revived the derby and held races throughout the city. Then in 2002, Ben Hueso, now a California State Senator, and community advocate James Justus began organizing Soap Box Derby races in Sherman Heights, where it is now held annually.",

He is not only an incredible asset to this body and to his constituents, but he also has a gregarious personality that draws people in and puts them immediately at ease. To put it another way, you always know when Steve Stivers enters the room.   But, perhaps the most impressive thing about Steve is his service in the Ohio Army National Guard. Having served his country with great distinction both here at home and overseas in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and Djibouti, he was recently promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. And fortunately, Mr. Speaker, Steve brought the leadership skills he learned in the military to Congress, and we are all better for it.",

When the decision was made to transform the school's cafeteria and gym into a dining room and ball room in an effort to save money on a venue, many students were at first skeptical and disappointed. Yet once they learned about the challenge, they became excited and very eager to raise money and awareness for the event. Additionally, the Hilton Washington Dulles Airport Hotel, the venue that had already been arranged for the event prior to the conception of this charity ball, generously returned the school its $5,000 deposit.",

To raise awareness students were asked to wear hats to the event, and some of the proceeds were in fact donated to this local organization. At the event, the food provided was all donated by Whole Foods and the National Conference Center, and the musical performers and photographers each volunteered their time. Lastly, the prom king and queen were not chosen by the student body, but they were instead selected based on who raised the most money in their name. Every final detail and moment of this event was thoroughly planned with the intent of assisting those with pediatric cancer, and ultimately, the event raised $48,000.",

        "statement": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Mr. William Adams Kimbrough, Jr. Billy, as he was known, was a leader in the Mobile community and a former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama.   Billy was born in Selma and grew up in Thomasville. He attended the University of the South, or Sewanee, where he was a member of the football team and active in campus affairs. He later graduated from the University of Alabama School of Law.   Under President John F. Kennedy, Billy served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney before working in the legal department at the GM&O Railroad in Mobile. He later joined the law firm of Stockman & Bedsole. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. He held his position until 1981. Following his service as U.S. Attorney, Billy joined the law firm of Turner Onderdonk where he practiced law until his retirement in 2012.   Billy was a proud Mobilian and participated in many groups and organizations around Southwest Alabama. He was active in politics throughout his life and took part in many political campaigns. He also worked with the Greater Gulf State Fair, of which he was the President in 1967.   He was also a man of strong and steady faith. He sang in the choir and taught Sunday School at Dauphin Way United Methodist Church in Mobile. He took great pride in seeing his church grow and flourish.   Sadly, Billy passed away on March 31st after a lengthy illness. Billy was more than just a colleague and fellow member of the Mobile Bar Association; he was also a friend of mine and my family.   On behalf of Alabama's First Congressional District, I want to share my deepest condolences with his wife of 58 years, Kay, his two children, Mary Elizabeth and Will, and his entire family. I hope you can take great comfort in the many memories together and the fact that Billy had such a profound impact on our community, state, and country.",

The facts are indisputable. Over 1.5 million Armenians were massacred during the first genocide of the 20th century.   As crimes of genocide continue to plague this world, Turkey's policy of denying the Armenian Genocide gives license to those who perpetrate genocide everywhere.

Schwartz and the other officers were sent by boat to the Japanese port of Tadotsu on the island of Shikoku to become slave laborers for Japanese corporations. Upon arrival in mainland Japan, Mr. Schwartz was taken to the Zentsuji POW Camp nearly 400 miles west of Tokyo. While in this camp, Lt. Schwartz was beaten and denied food, water, and medical service whenever he defended and advocated for those under his command. In September 1942, he was transferred to Tokyo 2B Kawasaki and later sent to Zentsuji in August of 1944. His final transfer was in June 1945 to POW Camp 11-B Rokuroshi. This camp was located in the Japanese Alps, where food was scarce, conditions were overcrowded, and winter clothes were unavailable, leading many to believe they would not survive the harsh mountain winter. However, the camp was discovered and liberated on September 8, 1945, several days after the formal surrender of Japan on September 2. After the war, Lt. Schwartz remained in the United States Navy and later retired in 1962 as a Commander.",

He called for a Southern Rural Development Commission, modeled after the Appalachian Regional Commission to assist economic development in rural communities in ten southern states. Congressman Hilliard reestablished Gees Bend Ferry. He attempted to protect and expand the Alabama military installations used by the U.S. Army and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. He worked to protect a Tuscaloosa-area airport that was difficult to sustain because of the region's sparse population. ``Tuscaloosa and the surrounding communities would suffer terribly without local air service, and this travel option will become increasingly important as industrial development continues in the area,'' he wrote to a colleague. Due in large part to Congressman Hilliard's lobbying, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees diverted limited funding to Tuscaloosa in the Essential Air Service legislation. He successfully pushed funding to support Alabama's historically black colleges and universities and provided scholarship money for minority students. Hilliard was also crucial in convincing a Korean-based car manufacturer to open a plant outside Montgomery. While in Congress, he served on the Agriculture, Small Business, International Relations and Foreign Affairs Committees. An active member of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Hilliard was elected vice chairman of the organization for the 105th Congress (1997 through 1999).",

I am talking about Thomas Jefferson, Tom Paine, and Ben Franklin. The original Americans wanted this to be a country of economic opportunity and freedom for people. But they thought the idea of inherited wealth passed down from generation to generation was a major threat to the idea of political equality and democracy for all. They saw that it would be unsustainable if you had huge fortunes--nowhere near as huge as they are today--but huge fortunes being passed down from generation to generation. That would lead us to an aristocracy; that would lead us to a monarchy; and that would lead us to Presidents of the United States who would think that they don't have to show you their income taxes, Presidents of the United States who think it is okay to spend public money on fancy vacations for their family and Secret Service all over the country and the world and having a winter or a summer escape at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, and so on.

He has worked at three community colleges in North Carolina's 8th Congressional District, which cover five of the twelve counties in my district. Dr. McInnis started as a business instructor at Montgomery Community College in 1992 before being named Vice President of Administrative Services the following year. He then worked at South Piedmont Community College before accepting a position at Richmond Community College in 2002. Dr. McInnis became Richmond Community College's seventh President in 2010, where he still serves today.   Mr. Speaker, Dr. McInnis has had a direct impact on the lives of thousands of hard-working folks across the 8th District. He has developed and implemented programs at these community colleges that helped people transition to new careers at a time of unprecedented textile and manufacturing job losses in the region.   Community colleges will continue to play a pivotal role in helping improve our economy in the coming years. Thanks to the strong leadership of Dr. McInnis, Richmond Community College is leading the charge in getting the workforce of Richmond and Scotland Counties the skills they need to thrive in a 21st century economy. I'm proud to have worked with Dr. McInnis over the years, and I know I speak for countless people across the 8th District when I congratulate him on being named Citizen of the Year.",

Breath-holding spells occur when a young child stops breathing for up to one minute, generally as a response to stress or emotions like fear and frustration. Sometimes, these spells cause the child to pass out. However, it is important to note that breath-holding is an involuntary reaction, and not something the child can control. While most children do not need treatment for breath-holding spells, they can be a difficult and scary experience for both parent and child.   Jennifer Horne of Prospect Park, PA, in the 7th district of Pennsylvania, is the founder of BHS Awareness. Ms. Horne's son, Brayden, suffers from BHS. Founded in 2013, the group is dedicated to providing medical facts and personal experiences from parents. BHS Awareness recently supported an effort in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to pass legislation officially recognizing July 14 as Involuntary Breath Holding Awareness Day.   Mr. Speaker, I honor BHS Awareness for its bravery and leadership regarding breath-holding spells. Ms. Horne and BHS Awareness are helping parents and children understand and cope with a difficult condition. Their hard work on this little-known condition is raising awareness for the children who experience these spells and the parents who care for them.",

David was a linchpin of the central Ohio veterans community for more than thirty years. In 1983, Dave took his first major steps in veterans advocacy as the Executive Director of the Vietnam Veterans of America--Department of Ohio. Over nine years in this position, he became a distinguished advisor throughout Ohio as a valued member of the Ohio Veterans Employment and Training Council and the Ohio Job Training Council. In 1991, he began his tenure as the Director of the Franklin County Veterans Service Commission and gave immeasurably to the service and care of hundreds of thousands of central Ohio's veterans.   I am extremely honored to play a small role in recognizing the life and accomplishments of such a uniquely dedicated public servant. Dave generously gave his time and energies to the many organizations and projects that have grown to shape the central Ohio veterans community. His leadership in these capacities was recognized by the Ohio Department of Veteran Services when he was inducted into the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame in 2012. I personally partnered with David on many projects, including advocating for the construction of the Chalmers P. Wylie Ambulatory Care Center in Columbus, Ohio. This facility stands, in part, as a testament to David's relentless work to better serve the veterans of Columbus and the surrounding area. His tireless efforts embodied the devotion and honor of our nation's military, and his service to central Ohio reflected the very best of what we the people demand from our public servants. His wisdom and indefatigable drive will be sorely missed in our communities, and I will miss his advice and counsel.   On behalf of the citizens of Ohio's 12th Congressional District, I thank David Bradley for his sacrifices for our nation and his unrelenting service to our community. I offer my deepest sympathies to his family. Their sense of loss at this time is shared by many of us who knew and loved David Bradley, and he will be dearly missed.",

On Friday, January 31st, Al will retire from his role as President and CEO of the Central Kentucky Community Foundation (CKCF). Since 1992, Al has worked to develop and implement initiatives to promote a good education and ensure that students follow through on those efforts.   Al has, at one time or another had a hand in virtually every component of education in central Kentucky. According to CKCF, Al has most recently served as the Educational Liaison for the transformation at Fort Knox, facilitator of the K-12 education roundtables, and as the chairperson of the Education Subcommittee of the Hardin County United Project.   An editorial in his hometown paper, The News-Enterprise, said it best. ``From that time to today, Rider has been an influential and instrumental player in improving educational opportunities and, thereby, quality of life in Hardin County.'' I could not agree more.   Al has received several awards relating to his leadership in the field of education, including: the Joseph W. Kelly Award from the Kentucky Department of Education and the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Lincoln Heritage Council Boy Scouts of America.   I am grateful for Al's dedication to bettering the education of Kentuckians and wish him well in his retirement.",

On January 25th, 2014, friends and fellow Fayette County, Tennessee residents are gathering for a Community Appreciation Reception and rejoice the 47 year entrepreneurship of the man simply known as ``Mr. Cathey.''   Mr. Dandridge was born and raised in the small Mississippi town of Thyatira, where his graduating high school class consisted of just 16 students. While in high school a young student named JoAnn Hawkins caught his eye and both ultimately attended the University of Memphis and were later married in 1960.   With a degree in Industrial Arts, Mr. Dandridge accepted a job from John Deere working in Cullman, Alabama. Proving to be a valued employee, Mr. Dandridge quickly moved up with new positions in Greenville, Mississippi and Brownsville, Tennessee. With a growing family, Mr. Dandridge made the decision to take a leap of business faith and purchase Warren Implement. Thus, Dandridge Equipment was brought into existence on October 11th, 1967.   What started as the smallest John Deere dealership in Tennessee grew over the years to include sales to Europe, Asia, South America, and all over North America achieving numerous awards and recognitions from John Deere. Locally, Mr. Dandridge and Dandridge Equipment received the Fayette County Chamber of Commerce's Large Business Award in 2011. Over the years ``Mr. Cathey'' employed 46 individuals with 582 years of combined service to his company.   W. Cathey Dandridge's life stands as a testament to the American dream. Humble and rural beginnings, hard work and dedication, appreciation and community service, are all hallmark traits of what it takes to create a successful business and more importantly a successful life. On behalf of Tennessee's 8th Congressional District, I congratulate and wish the best of luck to the family and friends of ``Mr. Cathey'' Dandridge for all future endeavors.",

There are inclinations for them to cost more in terms of dollars and cents than if we provided them with the tools for them to acquire decent jobs with decent living wages. People are talking about equality in wages, but I am not comfortable with that expression because I don't want some of my friends on the other side of the aisle thinking that I think everyone should have the same income in terms of equality; but when it comes to the equality of opportunity--when it comes to making certain that you can tell your kids that you are doing pretty good but that you know that they can do better--and then when it comes to those dreams being hurt because of examples that we find in this country, then it hurts the whole idea of manufacturers wanting to have their workers be in a position to buy the things that they are manufacturing or the services they are providing.",

It is a program many people depend on. It is a public-private partnership that provides affordable flood insurance for the middle class. But the bill was built backward and upside down. The bill had good intentions, but it has had very detrimental consequences. So the bill we are going to vote to go to debate on--the Menendez-Isakson bill--is really a good-faith attempt to correct some of the problems with Biggert-Waters and to lead us in a direction to a place where this country can have a public-private partnership for flood insurance that actually works for the taxpayer, for the millions and millions of people--5 million plus--who are going to have to have flood insurance, whether they have had it in the past or not. There are new maps that are coming and millions and millions of people will be required by the law to have flood insurance if they have a mortgage on their home, and most people have mortgages. Most people are unable to pay cash for their homes. Some people are fortunate to do so, but I would say 95 percent of the people have mortgages on their homes. So if people have mortgages, they are going to be required to have flood insurance, and if they are required to have flood insurance they will have Biggert-Waters, unless we can postpone it and instead get Menendez-Isakson.",

Curators usually oversee museums and private collections. The Senate, on the other hand, is a working building. Maintaining a balance between conservation and the considerations of working life for Members and staff is a unique task. In her role as Senate curator, Diane has worked fiercely to successfully strike this balance every day.",
