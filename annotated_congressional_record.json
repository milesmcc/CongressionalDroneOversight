The Soap Box Derby is a youth racing program that has run in the United States since 1934. Cars competing in the Soap Box Derby are unpowered and rely completely on gravity to accelerate. During its peak in the 1950s and 1960s, when automobile manufacturers were national sponsors and famous television and cinema stars made special guest appearances at these races, as many as 70,000 people throughout the United States gathered each August to cheer on hundreds of young participants.",

In 1946, San Diegan Gilbert Klecan became the first West Coast participant to win the All-American World Championship, which is held every July at Derby Downs in Akron, Ohio. In those years, it was not uncommon to have as many as 300 cars racing along 6th Avenue downhill from Laurel Street. In the early 1970s, after automobile manufacturers pulled their sponsorship, the derby gradually faded in many cities. However, in the early 1990s the Kiwanis Club of San Diego Harbor and the Kiwanis Club of San Diego revived the derby and held races throughout the city. Then in 2002, Ben Hueso, now a California State Senator, and community advocate James Justus began organizing Soap Box Derby races in Sherman Heights, where it is now held annually.",

There are three racing divisions in both the San Diego and the All-American competition where boys and girls, ages 8 through 17, compete. Though many things have changed since the first San Diego Soap Box Derby in 1939, the goals of the program have not: to teach youngsters basic workmanship skills, the spirit of competition and the commitment to finish a project once it is started.",

To put it another way, you always know when Steve Stivers enters the room.   But, perhaps the most impressive thing about Steve is his service in the Ohio Army National Guard. Having served his country with great distinction both here at home and overseas in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and Djibouti, he was recently promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. And fortunately, Mr. Speaker, Steve brought the leadership skills he learned in the military to Congress, and we are all better for it.",

When the decision was made to transform the school's cafeteria and gym into a dining room and ball room in an effort to save money on a venue, many students were at first skeptical and disappointed. Yet once they learned about the challenge, they became excited and very eager to raise money and awareness for the event. Additionally, the Hilton Washington Dulles Airport Hotel, the venue that had already been arranged for the event prior to the conception of this charity ball, generously returned the school its $5,000 deposit.",

To raise awareness students were asked to wear hats to the event, and some of the proceeds were in fact donated to this local organization. At the event, the food provided was all donated by Whole Foods and the National Conference Center, and the musical performers and photographers each volunteered their time. Lastly, the prom king and queen were not chosen by the student body, but they were instead selected based on who raised the most money in their name. Every final detail and moment of this event was thoroughly planned with the intent of assisting those with pediatric cancer, and ultimately, the event raised $48,000.",

Billy was born in Selma and grew up in Thomasville. He attended the University of the South, or Sewanee, where he was a member of the football team and active in campus affairs. He later graduated from the University of Alabama School of Law.   Under President John F. Kennedy, Billy served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney before working in the legal department at the GM&O Railroad in Mobile. He later joined the law firm of Stockman & Bedsole. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. He held his position until 1981. Following his service as U.S. Attorney, Billy joined the law firm of Turner Onderdonk where he practiced law until his retirement in 2012.   Billy was a proud Mobilian and participated in many groups and organizations around Southwest Alabama. He was active in politics throughout his life and took part in many political campaigns. He also worked with the Greater Gulf State Fair, of which he was the President in 1967.   He was also a man of strong and steady faith. He sang in the choir and taught Sunday School at Dauphin Way United Methodist Church in Mobile. He took great pride in seeing his church grow and flourish.   Sadly, Billy passed away on March 31st after a lengthy illness. Billy was more than just a colleague and fellow member of the Mobile Bar Association; he was also a friend of mine and my family.   On behalf of Alabama's First Congressional District, I want to share my deepest condolences with his wife of 58 years, Kay, his two children, Mary Elizabeth and Will, and his entire family. I hope you can take great comfort in the many memories together and the fact that Billy had such a profound impact on our community, state, and country.",

The facts are indisputable. Over 1.5 million Armenians were massacred during the first genocide of the 20th century.   As crimes of genocide continue to plague this world, Turkey's policy of denying the Armenian Genocide gives license to those who perpetrate genocide everywhere.

Upon arrival in mainland Japan, Mr. Schwartz was taken to the Zentsuji POW Camp nearly 400 miles west of Tokyo. While in this camp, Lt. Schwartz was beaten and denied food, water, and medical service whenever he defended and advocated for those under his command. In September 1942, he was transferred to Tokyo 2B Kawasaki and later sent to Zentsuji in August of 1944. His final transfer was in June 1945 to POW Camp 11-B Rokuroshi. This camp was located in the Japanese Alps, where food was scarce, conditions were overcrowded, and winter clothes were unavailable, leading many to believe they would not survive the harsh mountain winter. However, the camp was discovered and liberated on September 8, 1945, several days after the formal surrender of Japan on September 2. After the war, Lt. Schwartz remained in the United States Navy and later retired in 1962 as a Commander.",

Congressman Hilliard reestablished Gees Bend Ferry. He attempted to protect and expand the Alabama military installations used by the U.S. Army and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. He worked to protect a Tuscaloosa-area airport that was difficult to sustain because of the region's sparse population. ``Tuscaloosa and the surrounding communities would suffer terribly without local air service, and this travel option will become increasingly important as industrial development continues in the area,'' he wrote to a colleague. Due in large part to Congressman Hilliard's lobbying, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees diverted limited funding to Tuscaloosa in the Essential Air Service legislation. He successfully pushed funding to support Alabama's historically black colleges and universities and provided scholarship money for minority students. Hilliard was also crucial in convincing a Korean-based car manufacturer to open a plant outside Montgomery. While in Congress, he served on the Agriculture, Small Business, International Relations and Foreign Affairs Committees. An active member of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Hilliard was elected vice chairman of the organization for the 105th Congress (1997 through 1999).",

They saw that it would be unsustainable if you had huge fortunes--nowhere near as huge as they are today--but huge fortunes being passed down from generation to generation. That would lead us to an aristocracy; that would lead us to a monarchy; and that would lead us to Presidents of the United States who would think that they don't have to show you their income taxes, Presidents of the United States who think it is okay to spend public money on fancy vacations for their family and Secret Service all over the country and the world and having a winter or a summer escape at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, and so on.

I think--and forgive me for not having the facts in front of me--again, we are just getting this all right now, but I think we are now somewhere around $4.5 million. So if you die with $4.5 million, your estate is not going to be taxed. That is enough to send the kids and the grandkids to college. It is enough for people to inherit a house or two houses. That is not bad. But the fact that we would tax beyond that means that we are not going to get a society that is based on inherited wealth and deep, profound political and economic inequality which were totally anathema to the Founders of the country, and also, by the way, totally antithetical to the vision of Adam Smith who is the big hero to my conservative friends on the other side of the aisle.",
