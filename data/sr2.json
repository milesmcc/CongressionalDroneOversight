And those planes      that drop the bombs? The destroyers that carry the missiles?      They have pilots, captains, and crews. All humans. Even the      ``unmanned'' drones have human pilots, and the psychological      wear and tear on them is staggering. Planes take off from      airfields in foreign lands and from aircraft carriers, both      of which are staffed by thousands of American somebodies,      just like those destroyer ships. At every turn in a military      operation you will find people. Intel analysts, linguists,      flight crews, and cooks. Even war plans . . . rely on      thousands of people who will be pulled to a new duty, which      causes reshuffling far and wide in the military community.

        "statement": "The U.S. ambassador in Kabul sent two classified cables to      Washington in the past week expressing deep concerns about      sending more U.S. troops to Afghanistan until President Hamid      Karzai's government demonstrates that it is willing to tackle      the corruption and mismanagement that has fueled the      Taliban's rise, senior U.S. officials said.       Karl W. Eikenberry's memos, sent as President Obama enters      the final stages of his deliberations over a new Afghanistan      strategy, illustrated both the difficulty of the decision and      the deepening divisions within the administration's national      security team. After a top-level meeting on the issue      Wednesday afternoon--Obama's eighth since early last month--     the White House issued a statement that appeared to reflect      Eikenberry's concerns.       ``The President believes that we need to make clear to the      Afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended,''      the statement said. ``After years of substantial investments      by the American people, governance in Afghanistan must      improve in a reasonable period of time.''       On the eve of his nine-day trip to Asia, Obama was given a      series of options laid out by military planners with      differing numbers of new U.S. deployments, ranging from      10,000 to 40,000 troops. None of the scenarios calls for      scaling back the U.S. presence in Afghanistan or delaying the      dispatch of additional troops.       But Eikenberry's last-minute interventions have highlighted      the nagging undercurrent of the policy discussion: the U.S.      dependence on a partnership with a Karzai government whose      incompetence and corruption is a universal concern within the      administration. After months of political upheaval, in the      wake of widespread fraud during the August presidential      election, Karzai was installed last week for a second five-     year term.       In addition to placing the Karzai problem prominently on      the table, the cables from Eikenberry, a retired three-star      general who in 2006-2007 commanded U.S. troops in      Afghanistan, have rankled his former colleagues in the      Pentagon--as well as Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, defense      officials said. McChrystal, the top U.S. and NATO commander      in Afghanistan, has stated that without the deployment of an      additional tens of thousands of troops within the next year,      the mission there ``will likely result in failure.''       Eikenberry retired from the military in April as a senior      general in NATO and was sworn in as ambassador the next day.      His position as a former commander of U.S. forces in      Afghanistan is likely to give added weight to his concerns      about sending more troops and fan growing doubts about U.S.      prospects in Afghanistan among an increasingly pessimistic      public and polarized Congress.       Although Eikenberry's extensive military experience and      previous command in Afghanistan were the key reasons Obama      chose him for the top diplomatic job there, the former      general had been reluctant as ambassador to weigh in on      military issues. Some officials who favor an increase in      troops said they were surprised by the last-minute nature of      his strongly worded cables.       In these and other communications with Washington,      Eikenberry has expressed deep reservations about Karzai's      erratic behavior and corruption within his government, said      U.S. officials familiar with the cables. Since Karzai was      officially declared reelected last week, U.S. diplomats have      seen little sign that the Afghan president plans to address      the problems they have raised repeatedly with him.       U.S. officials were particularly irritated by a interview      this week in which a defiant Karzai said that the West has      little interest in Afghanistan and that its troops are there      only for self-serving reasons.       ``The West is not here primarily for the sake of      Afghanistan,'' Karzai told PBS's ``The NewsHour With Jim      Lehrer'' program. ``It is here to fight terrorism. The United      States and its allies came to Afghanistan after September 11.      Afghanistan was troubled like hell before that, too. Nobody      bothered about us.''       Karzai expressed indifference when asked about the      withdrawal of most of the hundreds of U.N. employees from      Afghanistan after a bombing late last month in Kabul. The      blast killed five foreign U.N. officials.       ``They may or may not return,'' he said. ``I don't think      Afghanistan will notice it.''       Eikenberry also has expressed frustration with the relative      paucity of funds set aside for spending on development and      reconstruction this year in Afghanistan, a country wrecked by      three decades of war. Earlier this summer, he asked for $2.5      billion in nonmilitary spending for 2010, a 60 percent      increase over what Obama had requested from Congress, but the      request has languished even as the administration has debated      spending billions of dollars on new troops.       The ambassador also has worried that sending tens of      thousands of additional American troops would increase the      Afghan government's dependence on U.S. support at a time when      its own security forces should be taking on more      responsibility for fighting. Before serving as the commander      of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, Eikenberry was in charge of      the Afghan army training program.       Each of the four options that were presented to Obama on      Wednesday were accompanied by troop figures and the estimated      annual costs of the additional deployments, roughly      calculated as $1 billion per thousand troops. All would draw      the United States deeper into the war at a time of economic      hardship and rising fiscal concerns at home.       Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense      Secretary Robert M. Gates have backed a major increase in      U.S. forces to drive the Taliban from populated areas and      provide Afghan security forces and the government the space      to snuff out corruption and undertake development projects.      They have argued that only a large-scale counterinsurgency      effort can produce a strong Afghan government capable of      preventing the country from once again become an al-Qaeda      haven.       Those views have been balanced in internal deliberations by      the hard skepticism of other Obama advisers, led by Vice      President Biden. They have argued for a more narrow      counterterrorism strategy that would not significantly expand      the U.S. combat presence.       The most ambitious option Obama received Wednesday calls      for 40,000 additional U.S. troops, as outlined by McChrystal      in his stark assessment of the war filed in late August.       Military planners put the additional annual cost of      McChrystal's recommendation at $33 billion, although White      House officials say the number is probably closer to $50      billion. The extra troops would allow U.S. forces to attempt      to take back and hold several Taliban havens in the southern      and eastern regions of Afghanistan.       One compromise option put forward by the Pentagon, with the      backing of Gates, would deploy an additional 30,000 to 35,000      U.S. troops--fewer than McChrystal's optimal number to carry      out his strategy--and rely on NATO allies to make up the      5,000- to 10,000-troop difference. The third option, known by      military planners as ``the hybrid,'' would send 20,000      additional U.S. troops to shore up security in 10 to 12 major      population areas. In the rest of the country, the military      would adopt a counterterrorism strategy targeting forces      allied with the Taliban and al-Qaeda, primarily in the north      and east, with fighter jets, Predator drones and Special      Operations troops that leave a light U.S. footprint on the      ground. The military puts the annual cost of that option at      $22 billion.       The most modest option calls for deploying an additional      10,000 to 15,000 troops. While under consideration at the      White House, the proposal holds little merit for military      planners because, after building bases to accommodate 10,000      or so additional soldiers and Marines, the marginal cost of      adding troops beyond that figure would rise only slightly.",

With the leadership of Jerry Lewis who was the chairman of the subcommittee at the time, this subcommittee and the Congress insisted that we buy, produce and deploy unmanned aerial vehicles. We call it the Predator; and next to the American soldier on the ground, al Qaeda fears that Predator more than any other weapon that we have. The Pentagon didn't want it. It was not in any budget request. Congress insisted, and it has become one of the most effective weapons that we have in the war against terror in Iraq and in Afghanistan.",

In July 2008, I took a trip to Iraq and Afghanistan to assess the current conditions on the ground. In a meeting with General David D. McKiernan, former Commander of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and former Commander, U.S. Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A), he emphasized that the most important tools needed to successfully conduct operations are more ``eyes in the sky,'' also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Most importantly, this request will help save lives through better intelligence gathering and greater strike capabilities. Furthermore, Predator C means more jobs contributing to San Diego's local economy. Predator C will provide the USAF and other customers with an additional covert capability, enhanced by much higher operational and transit speeds for quick response and quick repositioning for improved mission flexibility and survivability.",

Last week, we learned that Mr. Weinstein was an accidental victim of a U.S. drone strike that took place in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region in January of this year. This tragedy has deprived a family of their loving husband, father, and grandfather, and it has deprived our country of a tireless champion of human rights and economic development among some of the world's poorest populations.   Warren Weinstein dedicated over 40 years of his life to international development work. Throughout his career, he worked with vulnerable populations throughout Africa and South Asia. He served as Peace Corps country director in Togo and the Ivory Coast. Most recently, he spent 10 years working on economic development projects as an adviser to J.E. Austin Associates, a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) contractor, in Pakistan.   Mr. Weinstein's life and approach to development work showcased the ideals of the institutions that he served: USAID, the Peace Corps, and others. He left the comforts of home and dedicated his career to improving the lives of others in countries that were not his own. He spoke seven languages and immersed himself in the local culture of the countries in which he worked. By all accounts, he had a warm, outgoing personality and a deep commitment to solving some of the world's most difficult problems.   Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for the whole House in offering our deepest condolences to Mr. Weinstein's family and friends, especially his wife Elaine, their daughters Alisa and Jennifer, and their families. His legacy will live on in Pakistan, Togo, the Ivory Coast, and the entire range of countries in which he worked, and his service to our country and the world will never be forgotten. ",

The President discussed for the first time publicly information that many of our colleagues who work with intelligence issues have been aware of for quite some time. That involves Saddam Hussein's aggressive efforts to develop and use unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs, as a delivery method for his weapons of mass destruction. The SCUDs did not have a very long range. The SCUDs were not very accurate. I can attest to that because one night visiting with General Schwarzkopf during Desert Storm in Saudi Arabia, a SCUD was launched near our site, and it landed not too far away; but it was far enough away that it did not hurt anybody. So we know that the SCUDs were not that accurate. UAVs are a different story. UAVs have a much longer range; UAVs are able to be piloted and trained specifically on a target. UAVs are dangerous. And if my colleagues do not think UAVs have a long range, we ourselves have flown a UAV from the United States to Australia and back. Saddam is aggressively seeking ability to use those long-range UAVs to put so many more targets in his sights. We cannot let that happen.",

According to intelligence, Iraq has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of the 150 kilometer restriction imposed by the United Nations in the ceasefire resolution. Although Iraq's chemical weapons capability was reduced during the UNSCOM inspections, Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort over the last 4 years. Evidence suggests that it has begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including mustard gas, sarin, cyclosarin, and VX. Intelligence reports show that Iraq has invested more heavily in its biological weapons programs over the 4 years, with the result that all key aspects of this program--R, production and weaponization--are active. Most elements of the program are larger and more advanced than they were before the gulf war. Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating agents and is capable of quickly producing and weaponizing a variety of such agents, including anthrax, for delivery on a range of vehicles such as bombs, missiles, aerial sprayers, and covert operatives which could bring them to the United States homeland. Since inspectors left, the Iraqi regime has energized its missile program, probably now consisting of a few dozen Scud-type missiles with ranges of 650 to 900 kilometers that could hit Israel, Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the region. In addition, Iraq is developing unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs, capable of delivering chemical and biological warfare agents, which could threaten Iraq's neighbors as well as American forces in the Persian Gulf.",

This aircraft is plagued by cost overruns, technical problems and questions over whether the Air Force should direct its resources to expensive manned aircraft when newer technologies and strategies are more effective and less costly. The bill authorizes $1 billion for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) procurement and research and development. UAV's have the ability to provide first-hand reconnaissance of opposition forces without placing lives at risk. Moreover, UAV's have proven particularly valuable in Afghanistan by identifying and tracking enemy targets, and conducting missions too dangerous for manned aircraft. By canceling the F-22, the Air Force can free up substantial funding that can be used to more aggressively pursue programs such as long range bombers.

        "statement": "The International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military      Balance 2010 report places China third in the number of      artillery systems it fields, after Russia and North Korea.      But China doubtless exceeds both in resource commitment and      breadth of artillery investments. Credited with an estimated      17,700-plus towed, self-propelled and rocket systems, the      People's Liberation Army (PLA) has at least 56 artillery      systems in use, development or available for export. The U.S.      Army and Marine Corps, by contrast, have 8,187-plus artillery      pieces of roughly 10 types.        China has had a mixed record of using artillery for      military and political-military goals. Its successes as when      it routed Indian forces in 1962 with the high-altitude use of      artillery and mortars, have been offset by incidents      provoking third-party responses or leading to regional      standoffs. Examples include the shelling of islands      controlled by Taiwan in 1955-58, resulting in U.S.      intervention and a stalemate over the Taiwan Strait. In July,      a unit based in the Nanjing military region fired missiles      from 300-mm. PHL-03 multiple rocket launchers (MRLs) into the      Yellow Sea to show China's anger at U.S. naval exercises with      South Korea. The exercises, a result of China-backed North      Korea's sinking of the South Korean frigate Cheonon in March,      went ahead anyway.       China evolution as an artillery power stems from Soviet and      Russian influences dating to the Korean War Soviet artillery      and training improved PLA artillery operations during the war      and led to the formation of the first formal artillery      command. Soviet aid continued through the 1950s, and by the      time of the Sin-Soviet split of the 1960s, China was      producing copies or modified versions of Soviet pieces.       The PLA makes extensive use of Soviet-origin 152-, 130- and      122-mm. calibers, though Western calibers such as the 155-      and 105-mm. are seeing greater use. China purchased the      Russian 9A52 Smerch 300-mm. MRL in the 1990s, and the PLA      produced a near facsimile in the A-100/PHL-03 MRL. The 155-     mm. PLZ-05 self-propelled artillery system that emerged in      2005 bears an uncanny resemblance to the Russian 2519 MSTA.       In the 1990s, PLA artillery was affected by reforms in      strategy (its closest concept to doctrine) and organization.      Toward the end of the decade, the PLA was immersed in      strategy goals of ``informatization'' and ``mechanization.''      The former included the broad application of improving      information technologies, which for artillery included new      computer-based fire controls and ever-improving digital      communication and command linkages. PLA artillery units      increasingly include flrefinding counter-battery radar such      as the 50-km.-range (31-mi.) SLC-2 and Type 704, and use      sophisticated electronic warfare systems such as the Russian      SPR-2 radio fuse jammer, a possible Chinese facsimile and      possibly a recently revealed artillery radar jammer.      Artillery recon vehicles and recon troops feature advanced      optronic and digital communication capabilities. In addition,      PLA artillery units have sophisticated meteorological      capabilities and use muzzle velocity radar to improve      accuracy.       Mechanization put renewed emphasis on developing tracked      and wheeled self-propelled tubed artillery, with rocket      artillery largely truck-mounted. This trend was emphasized in      late 2004 when Chinese Communist Party and PLA leader Hu      Jintao enunciated the PLAs new ``historic missions,'' a      euphemism for invasions, which call on the PLA to defend      state interests abroad. It is likely that new medium-weight      artillery systems based on airmobile armored personnel      carriers will follow for these strategic missions.       Organic PLA artillery units have decreased in size,      following the pattern of general large-scale troop      reductions. When combined with ``informatization'' advances,      this will permit many infantry and armored divisions to be      reformed into mechanized brigades. However, in a counter-     trend that emphasizes their continued importance, the PLA      maintains five independent artillery divisions and 20      independent brigades. Of these, two divisions and six      brigades are stationed in the Shenyang and Beijing military      regions, for potential Korean contingencies. Three divisions      and eight brigades are in the Nanjing Guangzhou and Jinan      military regions, for Taiwan contingencies.       Among artillery systems, mortars include a 60-mm. hand-held      system used by infantry and special forces. The new Type 93      60-mm. fixed mortar weighs 22.4 kg. (49.2 lb.) and fires 20      rounds/min. to 5.5 km. There are also fixed W91 and W87 81-     mm. mortars that fire to 8 km. and 5.6 km., respectively. The      PLA has largely copied Russia's Vasilyek 81-mm. automatic      mortar, called the W99 or SM-4, which comes in a towed      version or mounted in a Hummer-like vehicle. It fires four      rounds in 2 sec. out to 6.2 km. The W86 120-mm. towed mortar      weighs 206 kg. and fires 20 rounds/min. to 4.7 km.       In 2001, the PLA revealed the PLL-05 mobile mortar based on      the Russian 120-mm. 2S23 NONA-SVK that it purchased in the      1990s, but mounted on a WZ-551 6 X 6 armored personnel      carrier (APC). It fires a rocket-assisted round 13.5 km. In      2007, the PLA revealed a laser-guided 120-mm. mortar round,      though it is not clear if it is in service.       Towed and self-propelled tubed systems dominate artillery      units. The largest number of towed guns are likely the 122-     mm. versions. These include the Type-96, based on the Russian      D-30, with a 360-deg. traversing base, and the simpler Type-     83. Their rocket-assisted rounds have a 27-km. range. The      Type-59 130-mm. towed gun fires a rocket-assisted round 44      km. Of heavy towed artillery, the 152-mm. Type-66, a copy of      the Russian D-20, is most numerous and fires rocket-assisted      rounds 28 km. In 1999, the PLA revealed the 155-mm. PLL01/WA      021 towed artillery system, based on the Austrian Noricum GH      N-45, which fires a rocket-assisted round 50 km. The PLL01      and the Type-66 fire 155- and 152-mm. versions of the Russian      Krasnopol laser-guided shell.       Self-propelled tubed artillery includes the PLL02, which      places the Type-86 100-mm. gun on a WZ-551 APC. In 2009, the      PLA revealed the new Type-07 122-mm. tracked artillery      system, which features hull and electronic improvements over      the previous Type-89 Tracked 122-mm. system. In 2009,      photographs appeared on the Internet of the SH-3, a truck-     mounted 122-mm. artillery system with digital control systems      in a hatch over the cab.       Heavy self-propelled systems include the 155-mm. PLZ-05,      which has a version of the PLL01 gun, and appeared in 2005.      It is replacing the 152-mm. Type-83, which entered service in      1983. The PLZ-05 also fires the Krasnopol laser-guided      projectile and a rocket-assisted round 50 km., and is capable      of flat-trajectory antitank fire. Unconfirmed reports state      the PLZ-05 has an automatic gun-loading system and weighs 35      tons.       PLA investments in rocket artillery are impressive. A five-     wheel all-terrain vehicle has been modified to carry a 107-     mm. MRL for experimental mechanized special forces units. The      tracked Type-89 and more recent Type-90 truck-mounted 122-mm.      MRL feature self-contained 40-round rocket reloaders. In      addition, the Smerch-derived 12-round PHL-03, which      reportedly fires a 150-km.-range missile, is entering      increasing numbers of artillery units. The latest AR1A export      variant features a modular U.S. MLR system-style 5-round      rocket carrier, which speeds reloading. In 2009, Norinco      revealed an as yet unidentified truck carrier for this 5-     round rocket box, similar to Lockheed Martin's High-Mobility      Artillery Rocket System.       The PLA is also investing in larger MRL systems. The 400-     mm. WS-2D reportedly has a range of 400 km., and one payload      features three ``killer unmanned aerial vehicles,'' according      to a Chinese report. An earlier 200-km.-range version, the      WS-3, uses navigation satellite guidance to achieve a      remarkable 50-meter (164-ft.) circular error probable. The WS      family complements the 150-km.-range P-12 and 250-km. B-611M      maneuverable navsat-guided short-range ballistic missiles      (SRBMs), which could supplement or replace the PLA's two      brigades of 300-600-km. DF-11A SRBMs.       New artillery systems are entering amphibious and airborne      units for possible missions abroad. PLA marine and army      amphibious units are receiving the Type-07B tracked 122-mm.      amphibious artillery system, which places the gun from the      Type-07 on a larger hull. Airborne units are equipped with a      version of the Type-96 122-mm. gun, but a new tracked      airmobile APC may feature a mortar or gun system. The ZBD-09      122-mm. gun system could eventually feature in airmobile army      units. Future artillery systems may feature electromagnetic      launch, an area of extensive research. The PLA is also      interested in ramjet-powered and stealth-coated artillery      shells.",

        "statement": "Madam Speaker, the truth about whether or not Saddam Hussein was trying to buy uranium from Niger has dominated the news for the past several weeks. Many of those challenging the administration on this issue are motivated more by politics than by policy. Some doing the challenging were strongly in favor of going to war against Iraq when it appeared politically popular to do so, but are now chagrined that the war is not going as smoothly as was hoped.   I am sure once the alleged attempt to buy uranium is thoroughly debunked, the other excuses for going to war will be examined with a great deal of scrutiny as well. It is obvious that the evidence used to justify going to war is now less than convincing.   The charge that Saddam Hussein had aluminum tubes used in manufacturing nuclear weapons was in error.   A fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles capable of dispensing chemical and biological weapons did not exist.   The 63,000 liters of anthrax and botulism have not been found, nor have any of the mobile germ labs. There are no signs of the 1 million pounds of sarin, mustard and VX gasses.   No evidence has been revealed to indicate Iraq was a threat to anyone's security, let alone ours.   The charge that Saddam Hussein was connected to the al Qaeda was wrong. Saddam Hussein's flaunting of the UN resolutions regarding weapons of mass destruction remains unproven.   How could so many errors have occurred? Some say it was ineptness while others claim outright deception and lies. There are some who say it was selective use of intelligence to promote a particular policy already decided upon. This debate, I am sure, will rage on for a long time, and since motivations are subjective and hard to prove, resolving the controversy will be difficult. However, this should not diminish the importance of sorting out the truth from the fiction, the errors from the malice.   One question, though, I hope gets asked is why should we use intelligence cited by a foreign government as a justification for going to war? One would think that with the billions we spend, we could fully rely on our own intelligence-gathering agencies.   Another point of interest, lacking a coherent foreign policy, we have support for war coming from different groups depending on circumstances unrelated to national defense. For instance, those who strenuously objected to Kosovo promoted war in Iraq. And those who objected to Iraq are now anxious to send troops to Liberia. For some, U.N. permission is important and necessary. For others, the U.N. is helpful as long as it endorses the war they want.   Only a few correctly look to the Constitution and to the Congress to sort out the pros and cons of each conflict and decide whether or not a declaration of war is warranted.   The sad fact is that we have lost our way. A threat to national security is no longer a litmus test for sending troops hither and yon, and the American people no longer require Congress to declare the wars we fight. Hopefully, some day that will be changed.   The raging debate over whether or not Saddam Hussein tried to buy uranium, as important as it is, distracts from the much more important strategic issue of what is the proper foreign policy in a republic.   Hopefully, we will soon seriously consider the policy of noninterventionism in the affairs of others. Avoiding entangling alliances and staying out of the internal affairs of other nations is a policy most conducive to peace and prosperity and one the Founders endorsed. Policing the world and nation building are not part of a constitutional republic.",

        "statement": "Sir, I would imagine that your article, ``Time to Get Out      of Afghanistan'' will result in some ``incoming'' on your      Command Post. First and foremost, let me say that I am in      total agreement with your assessment. Simply put, no desired      end state has ever been clearly articulated and no strategy      formulated that would lead us to achieve even an ill defined      end state.       A few points:       1. The strategy of ``clear, hold and build'' would lead one      to believe that the US and its Allies are capable of      coordinating the elements of national power needed to affect      such a strategy. Nothing could be further from the truth.      Just getting DOS and DOD on the same page is difficult enough      . . . getting NGO's and nation building expertise into the      fight is simply a non-starter in a country as dysfunctional      as Afghanistan.       2. Your point about troop strength required to ``protect''      the population and carry out effective counterinsurgency      operations is spot on. Instead of a surge of 21,000 troops,      McChrystal would need a surge of hundreds of thousands. Not      only would our Nation not support such a surge but, MOST      distressing, the Military could not support such a surge. Not      only are our troops being run ragged but, equally important      and totally off most people's radar screens, our equipment is      being run ragged. At some point in time, the bill for that      equipment will come due and it will be a very large bill.       3. Typical of the 21st Century fight, we are fighting ideas      as well as warriors. You cannot defeat ideas with bullets . .      . you must defeat them with better ideas. For many reasons      such as the dysfunction found in the Karzai government, the      tribal nature of the country, the abject poverty of the      average citizen, the inextricable link to Pakistan, we have      been unable to come up with better ideas. We are      systematically destroying the poppy fields . . . the      country's major source of revenue. At the same time, we are      trying to encourage other agricultural efforts. This is one      of our ``better ideas''?? Sad as it is to say, we would do      better to buy the poppy crop ourselves . . . ridding the      world of a source of drugs and maintaining the Afghan      economy.       4. What in Afghanistan is deemed in our Nation's vital      interest? Seriously? Who is the enemy? Seriously? Is the      enemy of the United States the Taliban? Is the enemy al      Queda? We need to determine the answer to those questions      immediately. One would think we would have answered them      already but none of our actions to date would indicate that      we have.       Finally, your recommendation is sound. I would put      ``hunter-killer teams'' along the borders and in suspected al      Queda strongholds. I would support them with intelligence,      logistics thru the use of parasail's, responsive airpower      (need to be close), armed and unarmed (fitted with cameras,      infrared, etc) drones, ``reach back'' capability for cruise      missiles, and other capability as needed. The H-K Teams      should be given minimal rules of engagement . . . when they      identify the bad guys, they need to be empowered to take them      out.       Again, don't be dismayed by the people who disagree with      you. There are many retired and active duty military who feel      you hit the bull's eye.           Semper Fidelis,",

        "statement": "On March 21, I reported to the Congress that the United      States, pursuant to a request from the Arab League and      authorization by the United Nations Security Council, had      acted 2 days earlier to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe by      deploying U.S. forces to protect the people of Libya from the      Qaddafi regime. As you know, over these last 2 months, the      U.S. role in this operation to enforce U.N. Security Council      Resolution 1973 has become more limited, yet remains      important. Thus, pursuant to our ongoing consultations, I      wish to express my support for the bipartisan resolution      drafted by Senators Kerry, McCain, Levin, Feinstein, Graham,      and Lieberman, which would confirm that the Congress supports      the U.S. mission in Libya and that both branches are united      in their commitment to supporting the aspirations of the      Libyan people for political reform and self-government.       The initial phase of U.S. military involvement in Libya was      conducted under the command of the United States Africa      Command. By April 4, however, the United States had      transferred responsibility for the military operations in      Libya to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and      the U.S. involvement has assumed a supporting role in the      coalition's efforts. Since April 4, U.S. participation has      consisted of: (1) non-kinetic support to the NATO-led      operation, including intelligence, logistical support, and      search and rescue assistance; (2) aircraft that have assisted      in the suppression and destruction of air defenses in support      of the no-fly zone; and (3) since April 23, precision strikes      by unmanned aerial vehicles against a limited set of clearly      defined targets in support of the NATO-led coalition's      efforts.       While we are no longer in the lead, U.S. support for the      NATO-based coalition remains crucial to assuring the success      of international efforts to protect civilians from the      actions of the Qaddafi regime. I am grateful for the support      you and other Members in Congress have demonstrated for this      mission and for our brave service members, as well as your      strong condemnation of the Qaddafi regime. Congressional      action in support of the mission would underline the U.S.      commitment to this remarkable international effort. Such a      Resolution is also important in the context of our      constitutional framework, as it would demonstrate a unity of      purpose among the political branches on this important      national security matter. It      has always been my view that it is better to take military      action, even in limited actions such as this, with      Congressional engagement, consultation, and support.",

He was alleged to be involved in killing Americans and collaborating to kill our allies. On September 30, 2011, it was reported that al-Awlaki was killed by the CIA in a drone strike in Yemen. Yet it is being interpreted, as we have heard by some of my colleagues represented here, if the Feinstein amendment were interpreted the way they have interpreted, if al-Awlaki made it to America to commit these terrorist acts, he gets his Miranda rights. He gets all his rights here. But yet if he is in Yemen to do these acts, to try to kill Americans and our allies, then we can use a drone attack to him. But if he makes it to America--which, by the way, the terrorists want to make it to America; 9/11 is Exhibit A of that--why do we want to be in a position to read them their Miranda rights, tell them you have the right to remain silent?

The bill addresses new threats of this new century--ranging from areas such as Ballistic Missile Defense, to force protection measures for our troops in the field, and new equipment and technologies such as aerial refueling aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. It also fully funds the President's initiatives in the area of military pay and quality of life programs--such as the largest military pay raise in 15 years, and more than a 50 percent increase in funding for the medical programs supporting our troops and their families. And it includes a new title to deal with counter-terrorism--ranging from more funding for intelligence, to providing additional resources in the area of so-called ``cyber war'' (computer network protection) and improved equipment and research to counter the threats of chemical and biological weapons.",

This project increases effectiveness of the current fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) by enabling multiple UAVs and multiple sensors to cooperate in the same airspace with dynamic mission execution. Proxy Aviation Systems has developed and demonstrated the power of UAS cooperative engagement capability that can reduce the manpower and increase the mission effectiveness of current UAS. The Universal Distributed Management System (UDMS) is a demo proven (TRL-6) autonomous command and control system that will enable up to twelve UAVs to operate simultaneously from a single ground station and perform complex tactical objectives. The upgrade of existing and future US Government UAVs with a Cooperative Engagement capability will significantly reduce the manning required to operate current UAV systems which will lower costs while increasing mission effectiveness",

        "statement": "Atlanta.--The United States is abandoning its role as the      global champion of human rights.       Revelations that top officials are targeting people to be      assassinated abroad, including American citizens, are only      the most recent, disturbing proof of how far our nation's      violation of human rights has extended. This development      began after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and has      been sanctioned and escalated by bipartisan executive and      legislative actions, without dissent from the general public.      As a result, our country can no longer speak with moral      authority on these critical issues.       While the country has made mistakes in the past, the      widespread abuse of human rights over the last decade has      been a dramatic change from the past. With leadership from      the United States, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights      was adopted in 1948 as ``the foundation of freedom, justice      and peace in the world.'' This was a bold and clear      commitment that power would no longer serve as a cover to      oppress or injure people, and it established equal rights of      all people to life, liberty, security of person, equal      protection of the law and freedom from torture, arbitrary      detention or forced exile. The declaration has been invoked      by human rights activists and the international community to      replace most of the world's dictatorships with democracies      and to promote the rule of law in domestic and global      affairs. It is disturbing that, instead of strengthening      these principles, our government's counterterrorism policies      are now clearly violating at least 10 of the declaration's 30      articles, including the prohibition against ``cruel, inhuman      or degrading treatment or punishment.''       Recent legislation has made legal the president's right to      detain a person indefinitely on suspicion of affiliation with      terrorist organizations or ``associated forces,'' a broad,      vague power that can be abused without meaningful oversight      from the courts or Congress (the law is currently being      blocked by a federal judge). This law violates the right to      freedom of expression and to be presumed innocent until      proved guilty, two other rights enshrined in the declaration.       In addition to American citizens' being targeted for      assassination or indefinite detention, recent laws have      canceled the restraints in the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act of 1978 to allow unprecedented violations of      our rights to privacy through warrantless wiretapping and      government mining of our electronic communications. Popular      state laws permit detaining individuals because of their      appearance, where they worship or with whom they associate.       Despite an arbitrary rule that any man killed by drones is      declared an enemy terrorist, the death of nearby innocent      women and children is accepted as inevitable. After more than      30 airstrikes on civilian homes this year in Afghanistan,      President Hamid Karzai has demanded that such attacks end,      but the practice continues in areas of Pakistan, Somalia and      Yemen that are not in any war zone. We don't know how many      hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed in these      attacks, each one approved by the highest authorities in      Washington. This would have been unthinkable in previous      times.       These policies clearly affect American foreign policy. Top      intelligence and military officials, as well as rights      defenders in targeted areas, affirm that the great escalation      in drone attacks has turned aggrieved families toward      terrorist organizations, aroused civilian populations against      us and permitted repressive governments to cite such actions      to justify their own despotic behavior.       Meanwhile, the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,      now houses 169 prisoners. About half have been cleared for      release, yet have little prospect of ever obtaining their      freedom. American authorities have revealed that, in order to      obtain confessions, some of the few being tried (only in      military courts) have been tortured by waterboarding more      than 100 times or intimidated with semiautomatic weapons,      power drills or threats to sexually assault their mothers.      Astoundingly, these facts cannot be used as a defense by the      accused, because the government claims they occurred under      the cover of ``national security.'' Most of the other      prisoners have no prospect of ever being charged or tried      either.       At a time when popular revolutions are sweeping the globe,      the United States should be strengthening, not weakening,      basic rules of law and principles of justice enumerated in      the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But instead of      making the world safer, America's violation of international      human rights abets our enemies and alienates our friends.       As concerned citizens, we must persuade Washington to      reverse course and regain moral leadership according to      international human rights norms that we had officially      adopted as our own and cherished throughout the years.       Jimmy Carter, the 39th president, is the founder of the      Carter Center and the recipient of the 2002 Nobel Peace      Prize.",

        "statement": "President Obama failed to offer a convincing military or      strategic rationale for      the troop withdrawals from Afghanistan that he announced      Wednesday night. In several ways, they are at odds with the      strategy adopted by NATO, which aims to turn over the war to      the Afghan army by the end of 2014. For that plan to succeed,      military commanders believe that U.S. and allied forces must      hold the areas in southern Afghanistan that have been cleared      of the Taliban through this summer's fighting season as well      as that of 2012. They also must sweep eastern provinces that      have not yet been reached by the counterinsurgency campaign.       By withdrawing 5,000 U.S. troops this summer and another      5,000 by the end of the year, Mr. Obama will make those tasks      harder. By setting September 2012 as a deadline for      withdrawing all of the 33,000 reinforcements he ordered in      late 2009, the President risks undermining not only the war      on the ground but also the effort to draw elements of the      Taliban into a political settlement; the militants may prefer      to wait out a retreating enemy. It also may be harder to gain      cooperation from Pakistan, whose willingness to break with      the Taliban is linked to its perception of U.S. determination      to remain engaged in the region. U.S. allies, which have      committed 40,000 troops to the 2014 plan, may revise their      own exit strategies.       An accelerated withdrawal of American forces would make      more sense if Mr. Obama had decided to abandon the modified      counterinsurgency plan he adopted at the end of 2009, which      was later expanded and endorsed by NATO. Vice President      Biden, among others, has pressed for a more limited      counterterrorism strategy focused on combating al-Qaeda. But      Mr. Obama offered no indication in Wednesday's speech that he      has altered his objectives. Instead, he argued that the      reduction is possible because ``we are achieving our goals. .      . . We are starting this drawdown from a position of      strength.''       Mr. Obama correctly pointed out that the killing of Osama      bin Laden and operations in Pakistan have weakened al-Qaeda      and limited its ability to attack the United States. But a      Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan, which Mr. Obama's      withdrawals risk, would be deeply destabilizing for a region      that includes nuclear-armed Pakistan and India. If the Afghan      government or army crumbles, there would be a considerable      chance that the United States would lose the bases it now      uses for drone attacks against al-Qaeda.       Perhaps the best justification for Mr. Obama's decision is      U.S. domestic opinion. As senior administration officials      have pointed out, Americans have grown weary of the war;      polls show that a majority support a rapid withdrawal of U.S.      forces, and that view is increasingly reflected in Congress      and even among Republican presidential candidates. Many in      Congress cite the cost of the war--though the few billion      dollars saved through a faster withdrawal will have little      impact on a deficit measured in trillions.       By announcing these pullouts, Mr. Obama may ease some of      the political pressure while still allowing his commanders      enough forces to complete the 2014 transition plan. The      president's supporters point out that at the end of 2012,      there will still be twice as many U.S. troops in      Afghanistan--68,000--as when Mr. Obama took office. We hope      those prove sufficient. But Mr. Obama's withdrawal decision,      with no clear basis in strategy, increases the risk of      failure.",

As the Senior Executive responsible for developing, integrating, testing, and procuring advanced kill vehicles for all exo-atmospheric interceptors, Mr. Matlock defined a modular kill vehicle concept that decreased the number of system developments which reduced cost and risk. Mr. Matlock also redirected the agency's modeling and simulation approach by using state of the art open architecture frameworks that allowed plug and play capability of a disparate set of models from a diverse contractor base thus eliminating intellectual property loss and reducing the time required for model code rewrite.",

        "statement": "Give Rand Paul credit for theatrical timing. As the storm      descended on Washington, the Kentucky Republican's old-     fashioned filibuster Wednesday filled the attention void on      Twitter and cable TV. If only his reasoning matched the      showmanship.       Shortly before noon, Senator Paul began talking filibuster      against John Brennan's nomination to lead the CIA. The tactic      is rarely used in the Senate and was last seen in 2010. But      Senator Paul said an ``alarm'' had to be sounded about the      threat to Americans from their own government. He promised to      speak ``until the President says, no, he will not kill you at      a cafe.'' He meant by a military drone. He's apparently      serious, though his argument isn't.       Senator Paul had written the White House to inquire about      the possibility of a drone strike against a U.S. citizen on      American soil. Attorney General Eric Holder replied that the      U.S. hasn't and ``has no intention'' to bomb any specific      territory. Drones are limited to the remotest area of      conflict zones like Pakistan and Yemen. But as a hypothetical      constitutional matter, Mr. Holder acknowledged the President      can authorize the use of lethal military force within U.S.      territory.       This shocked Senator Paul, who invoked the Constitution and      Miranda rights. Under current U.S. policy, Mr. Paul mused on      the floor, Jane Fonda could have been legally killed by a      Hellfire missile during her tour of Communist Hanoi in 1972.      A group of noncombatants sitting in public view in Houston      may soon be pulverized, he declared.       Calm down, Senator. Mr. Holder is right, even if he doesn't      explain the law very well. The U.S. Government cannot      randomly target American citizens on U.S. soil or anywhere      else.",

As the Senator knows, Attorney General Holder responded in writing he could imagine a circumstance where that would be permissible. The two examples he gave were: No. 1, Pearl Harbor; and No. 2, the tragic attacks on this country on September 11, 2001. In the course of the hearing, Attorney General Holder was asked for more specifics. In particular, both of those were military strikes on our country with imminent and, indeed, grievous loss of life that flowed from it. Few, if any, disagree that the U.S. Government may act swiftly to prevent a military attack which would mean immediate loss of life. The question Attorney General Holder was asked three different times was whether the U.S. Government could take a U.S. citizen, who was suspected of being a terrorist, on U.S. soil, who was not engaged in any imminent threat to life or bodily harm, simply sitting at a cafe--could the U.S. Government use a drone strike to kill that U.S. citizen on U.S. soil.",

The Attorney General is the chief legal officer of the United States. I will note I observed it was more than a little astonishing the chief legal officer of the United States could not give a simple one-word, one-syllable, two-letter answer to the question: Does the Constitution allow the Federal Government to kill with a drone strike a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil who is not posing an immediate threat?

I think maybe recounting the letter gives it a little more strength than the letter actually possesses in its own words. If he were to say we were ruling out all strikes other than extraordinary strikes, that would actually be a pretty good letter. Instead he says he can imagine this under certain circumstances, and he lists a couple of circumstances. The interesting thing is that a lot of us agree that in a situation such as Pearl Harbor and 9/11--probably the Senator from Oregon and probably me--we can repel a military attack. The reason we asked the next question, and the reason I am concerned about the next question--and I have only seen the unclassified version of these--but the unclassified versions of the drone attacks indicate that a significant amount of them are not killing people with a weapon. People like to talk about taking up arms. Well, a lot of people are not carrying around arms. It doesn't make them good people, but they are not carrying around arms. They are not actively shooting our soldiers or us. At the particular time they kill them, they look like noncombatants. If we have somebody sitting in a cafe in our country--even if it is a bad person--most of us would probably rather arrest that person. If they were arrested, one, they would get the due process of our country; and two, if they were bad people, we might actually get information from them.

I think we all agree to that.

I am already getting tired and I don't know how long I will be able to do this, so I can't ultimately stop the nomination. But what I can do is try to draw attention to this and try to get an answer. That would be something, if we could get an answer from the President. And I think we would all sleep better and feel more comfortable if he would say explicitly that noncombatants in America won't be killed with drones. The reason it has to be answered is because our foreign drone strike program does kill noncombatants. They may argue they are conspiring or they may some day be combatants, but if that is the same standard we are going to be using in the United States, it is a far different country than I know about. Ours is a country where dissent, vocal dissent, even vehement, vociferous dissent as far as whether our country should go to war, whether our country should raise taxes, lower taxes, has always been allowed. We allow a great deal of dissent in our country. But some of the people whom we have said we are targeting have been dissenters, probably traitors too, but they have also been people who have been vocalizing it more than they have been shooting anybody.",

All of which leads Micah Zenko at the Council of Foreign      Relations to wonder where this drone campaign is going. ``By      any common-sense definition, these vast targeted killings      should be characterized as America's Third War since 9/11,''      he writes. ``Unlike Iraq and Afghanistan--where government      agencies acted according to articulated strategies,      congressional hearings and press conferences provided some      oversight and timelines explicitly stating when the U.S.      combat role would end--the Third War is Orwellian in its lack      of cogent strategy, transparency, and end date.''       ``Since these attacks are covert, the administration will      offer no public defense, he adds.

        "statement": "Over the past 2 years, the Obama administration has been      secretly developing a new blueprint for pursuing terrorists,      a next-generation targeting list called the ``disposition      matrix.''       The matrix contains the names of terrorism suspects arrayed      against an accounting of the resources being marshaled to      track them down, including sealed indictments and clandestine      operations. U.S. officials said the database is designed to      go beyond existing kill lists, mapping plans for the      ``disposition'' of suspects beyond the reach of American      drones.       Although the matrix is a work in progress, the effort to      create it reflects a reality setting in among the nation's      counterterrorism ranks: The United States' conventional wars      are winding down, but the government expects to continue      adding names to kill or capture lists for years.       Among senior Obama administration officials, there is a      broad consensus that such operations are likely to be      extended at least another decade. Given the way al-Qaida      continues to metastasize, some officials said no clear end is      in sight.       ``We can't possibly kill everyone who wants to harm us,'' a      senior administration said. ``It's a necessary part of what      we do . . . We're not going to wind up in 10 years in a world      of everybody holding hands any saying, ``We love America.''       That timeline suggests that the United States has reached      only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on      terrorism. Targeting lists that were regarded as finite      emergency measures after the attacks of September 11 are now      fixtures of the national security apparatus. The rosters      expand and contract with the pace of drone strikes but never      go to zero.       Meanwhile, a significant milestone looms: The number of      militants and civilians killed in the drone campaign over 10      years will soon exceed 3,000 by certain estimates.",

        "statement": "The Obama administration has touted its successes against      the terrorist network, including the death of Osama bin      Laden, as signature achievements that argue for President      Obama's reelection. The administration has taken tentative      steps toward greater transparency, formally acknowledging for      the first time the United States' use of armed drones.       Less visible is the extent to which Obama has      institutionalized the highly classified practice of targeted      killing, transforming ad-hoc elements into a counterterrorism      infrastructure capable of sustaining a seemingly permanent      war.       Spokesmen for the White House, the National      Counterterrorism Center, the CIA and other agencies declined      to comment on the matrix. Privately, officials acknowledge      that the development of the matrix is part of a series of      moves, in Washington and overseas, to embed counterterrorism      tools into U.S. policy for the long haul.       White House counterterrorism adviser John O. Brennan is      seeking to codify the administration's approach to generating      capture/kill lists, part of a broader effort . . .       CIA Director David Petraeus is pushing for an expansion of      the agency's fleet of armed drones. The proposal, which would      need White House approval, reflects the agency's      transformation into a paramilitary force and makes clear that      it does not intend to dismantle its drone program and return      to pre-September 11 focus on gathering intelligence.       The U.S. Joint Special Operations Command, which carried      out the raid that killed bin Laden, has moved command teams      into suspected terrorist hotbeds in Africa. A rugged U.S.      outpost in Djibouti has been transformed into a launchpad for      counterterrorism operations across the Horn of Africa and      into the Middle East.       The Joint Special Operations Command has also established a      secret targeting center across the Potomac River from      Washington. The current and former U.S. official said the      elite command's targeting cells have traditionally been      located along the front lines of its missions, including Iraq      and Afghanistan. But the joint committee has now created a      national capital region task force that is a 15-minute      commute from the White House so it can be more directly      involved in deliberations about the al-Qaida list.       The developments were described by current and former      officials from the White House as well as intelligence and      counterterrorism agencies. Most spoke on the condition of      anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. These      counterterrorism components have been affixed to a legal      foundation for targeted killings the Obama administration      has discussed more openly over the past year. In a series      of speeches, administration officials have cited the legal      basis, including the congressional authorization to use      military force.",

Of note and of consideration also is whether the legal      framework of the program that has been publicly asserted so      far by the administration comports with international legal      requirements.       The totality of these concerns, heightened by the lack of      public information surrounding the program, require the      administration to better explain the program and its legal      basis and to carefully review the policy in light of the      global precedent it is setting and serious questions about      the effectiveness of the program on the full range of U.S.      counterterrorism efforts. While it is expected that elements      of the U.S. Government's strategy for a targeted killing will      be classified, it is in the national interest that the      government be more transparent about policy considerations      governing its use as well as its legal justification, and      that the program be subject to regular oversight.      Furthermore, it is in the U.S. national security interests to      ensure that the rules of engagement are clear and that the      program minimizes any unintended negative consequences.       How the U.S. operates and publicly explains its targeted      killing programs will have far-reaching consequences. The      manufacture and sale of unmanned aerial vehicles is an      increasing global industry and drone technology is not      prohibitively complicated.",

I think if that number were released, if that number were made public, it would concern you even more because you may well find out a lot of the people--and we have seen some of the strikes on television, with people in their cars, people walking around without weapons, people eating dinner, people at home in their houses. I am not saying these are good people necessarily, I am just saying the drone strike program we have in place currently seems to have a very low threshold for whom they kill.

Nobody is opposed to using a drone when there is a lethal imminent force. The problem is it has gotten so convoluted. The President said an imminent threat doesn't have to be immediate. So that is the kind of thing we are concerned about. We are not concerned about an imminent or lethal threat where someone responds. What we are concerned about is a drone strike against a noncombatant. It seems as though it ought to be an easy question for the President. Couldn't he at least respond and say, I have always believed this, I just forgot to mention it, and we weren't very clear in the way we expressed it but, obviously, we would never use a drone against a noncombatant. He needs to say that, though, because the drones overseas are being used against noncombatants and we need to know what the rules are going to be.",

The Obama team has said next to nothing about how it works or      what laws restrict it. Until Monday.       Attorney General Eric Holder explained the administration's      reasoning for killing American citizens overseas--and only      overseas--with drone strikes and other means during a Monday      speech at Northwestern University. Holder claimed that the      government can kill ``a U.S. citizen who is a senior      operational leader of al-Qaida or associated forces''      provided the government--unilaterally--determines that      citizen poses ``an imminent threat of violent attack''--",

        "statement": "Dear Senator Paul:       On February 20, 2013, you wrote to John Brennan requesting      additional information concerning the Administration's views      about whether ``the President has the power to authorize      lethal force, such as a drone strike, against a U.S. citizen      on U.S. soil, and without trial.''       As Members of this Administration have previously      indicated, the U.S. government has not carried out drone      strikes in the United States and has no intention of doing      so. As a policy matter, moreover, we reject the use of      military force where well-established law enforcement      authorities in this country provide the best means for      incapacitating a terrorist threat. We have a long history of      using the criminal justice system to incapacitate individuals      located in our country who pose a threat to the United States      and its interests abroad. Hundreds of individuals have been      arrested and convicted of terrorism-related offenses in our      Federal courts.       The question you have posed is therefore entirely      hypothetical, unlikely to occur, and one we hope no President      will ever have to confront. It is possible, I suppose, to      imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be      necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and      applicable laws of the United States for the President to      authorize the military to use lethal force within the      territory of the United States. For example, the President      could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the      military to use such force if necessary to protect the      homeland in the circumstances of a catastrophic attack like      the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11, ",

No one is arguing against drones or any other kinds of force to defend the country against any kind of an attack. What we are arguing for is that noncombatants--people not engaged in combat in our country--are due fifth amendment protections, and that the White House should acknowledge this. This is important because the drone strikes overseas, when looking at the category and looking at the way they are being done and under what standards, there are some of those standards that we don't think are appropriate for U.S. citizens on U.S. soil. So we are asking for a clarification. We think Attorney General Holder got close to that today, under the duress of cross-examination. We wish to see him do it voluntarily in a nice, concise statement and we would be happy to vote on the Brennan nomination as early as tomorrow morning.",

Hundreds of individuals have been      arrested and convicted of terrorism-related offenses in our      federal courts.       The question you have posed is therefore entirely      hypothetical, unlikely to occur, and one we hope no President      will ever have to confront.

An example of that is the unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs--airplanes without pilots. It is a growing part of a number of services. But what is happening in both the Army and the Air Force is that both services are building and buying unmanned aerial vehicles in what I think are duplicative programs. One calls their airplane the Predator. The other calls it the Warrior. The folks over at the Pentagon can't determine who should be the executive agency that oversees the unmanned aerial vehicles. So you have two services doing essentially the same thing.",

        "statement": "Senator Rand Paul may have staged a Senate-shaking      filibuster Wednesday, but his was actually only the second      most significant Republican filibuster of the day.       In a vote just before Mr. Paul, the junior senator from      Kentucky, tried to blockade the nomination of John Brennan as      director of central intelligence over drone policy, the      Senate failed to end debate on the nomination of Caitlin J.      Halligan of New York to a seat on the federal appeals court      for the District of Columbia.       The filibuster of Ms. Halligan didn't blow up on Twitter      the way Mr. Paul's impressive 12-hour stand did. But of the      two, it was the one that could renew a feud over rules      governing filibusters and how the Senate handles high-level      judicial nominations--an issue that has torn the chamber for      years.       Democrats are already in discussions on how to respond to      the Halligan filibuster. They believe Republicans are dead      set against confirming qualified Obama administration      nominees to the United States Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia Circuit. They accuse Republicans of      exaggerating their objections to Ms. Halligan to justify a      filibuster under a 2005 agreement that short-circuited the      last partisan showdown over filling judicial vacancies.       That deal, crafted by the famous Gang of 14, put its      signatories on record as saying they would not block      confirmation votes on appeals court judges without      ``extraordinary circumstances'' as determined by each      individual. While only members of the gang signed it, it      became informal Senate policy and defused a crisis that had      Republicans threatening to execute the ``nuclear option'' and      bar filibusters against judicial nominees by a simple      majority vote instead of with the 67 votes historically      needed to change Senate rules.       It also led to President George W. Bush winning three      appointments to the appeals court often considered a feeder      to the Supreme Court, giving conservatives an advantage on      the influential panel, which hears      many federal-powers cases. In its current makeup, the court      consists of four judges appointed by Republican presidents      and three appointed by President Bill Clinton, with four      vacancies--the most ever on that court.       In filibustering Ms. Halligan, several Republicans cited      extraordinary circumstances arising from her earlier work as      the solicitor general for the State of New York, particularly      on a case against gun manufacturers.       ``Ms. Halligan advanced the novel legal theory that gun      manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers contributed to a      `public nuisance' of illegal handguns in the state,'' said      Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on      the Judiciary Committee, accusing her of judicial activism.      ``Therefore, she argued, gun manufacturers should be liable      for the criminal conduct of third parties.''       Democrats cried foul. The real reason she was blocked, they      say, is that Republicans do not want to see the balance of      power on the D.C. appeals court shifted. They say that Ms.      Halligan was acting in her official capacity representing the      State of New York, not as a jurist, and that Republicans have      abandoned the extraordinary circumstances test engineered by      the Gang of 14.       ``If you go back to that history of what occurred back      then, there is a real question of whether they have broken      the deal now,'' said Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New      Mexico. ``This is a key circuit for the country. What they      are doing is not allowing these consensus candidate judges to      get votes.''       Mr. Udall has been among a group of relatively newer      members of the Senate clamoring for significant changes in      the rules governing filibusters. One demand is that senators      act more like Mr. Paul, and take the floor to make their case      when they are trying to block a vote. In January, working to      avoid a divisive fight, Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada      Democrat and majority leader, and Senator Mitch McConnell of      Kentucky, the Republican leader, struck a deal making some      modest changes in filibuster rules.       But those changes have done little so far this session to      curb filibusters, as evidenced by the vote on Ms. Halligan      and the politically charged obstacles raised to confirmation      votes on Mr. Brennan and Chuck Hagel, a former Republican      senator who found himself on the receiving end of a      Republican filibuster before winning confirmation as      secretary of defense. The filibuster is alive and well in the      Senate and, as Mr. Paul showed, may even be enjoying      resurgence as grand theater.       Democrats say that despite what they see as clear      provocation, they are in no hurry to change the new rules      after just two months in place. They say they are more      inclined to explore new ways to confront Republicans over the      vacancies.       Mr. Udall says one option might be for the president to      make multiple nominations, in effect daring Republicans to      find ways to cite extraordinary circumstances in multiple      instances.       ``Rather than putting just one up, we should put before the      Senate all four and expose what is happening here,'' said Mr.      Udall, who acknowledged that Senate Democrats would need      White House cooperation.       ``We need to design a strategy to counter the Republicans,      and we are going to need the president,'' he said.       The fight will take time to unfold. Democrats say they will      wait to see how Republicans respond to future appeals court      nominees. But a series of filibusters against what they view      as acceptable nominees could quickly bring to a head the push      for a change in Senate rules.",

        "statement": "This week, amid the hullabaloo over President Barack      Obama's Deficit Dinner Diplomacy and Senator Rand Paul's 13-     hour filibuster-cum-dissertation on drone strikes and civil      liberties, financial news-watchers touted a milestone in      their lives of Market Worship. We speak, of course, of the      Dow Jones Industrial Average, which on Tuesday hit an ``all-     time high'' of 14,253. The good times rolled steadily on      through the week, and the Dow closed Friday at 14,397.       Of course, the notion that these were ``record'' highs was      not, strictly speaking, true. As Jeff Cox at CNBC pointed      out, ``In inflation-adjusted dollars, the Dow would need to      hit 15,731 to break the record.'' Nevertheless, the exciting      new ordinal number sitting on the stock market index set off      a chorus of hallelujahs. After all, this was the highest mark      it had hit since October 2007. (Of course, if we recall      correctly, that was right around the time that all of our      more recent tragic economic events began to occur.)       The fluctuations of the Dow are typically pored over by the      media in the same way that ancient oracles pierced through      the entrails of birds, seeking for whatever path might lead      to the most prosperity. And in the world of politics,      partisans on both sides are quick to point to the Dow as      generic confirmation that their policies are working as long      as the story suits their narrative anyway.       And these narratives can get wild and weird and wooly      quickly. Seemingly within moments of the Dow's peak, ``Dow      36,000'' author James Glassman was on the pages of Bloomberg      View, taking credit for this and crowing about how his old,      failed predictions were well on the way to coming true.       Of course, as Jonathan Chait points out, Glassman has to      toss out the entire underlying thesis of ``Dow 36,000.'' (He      and coauthor Kevin Hassett ``theorized that the stock market,      circa 1999, was being so undervalued that it would have been      at 36,000 in the days ahead of the massive tech-bubble burst      as opposed to theorizing that ``someday, maybe the Dow would      hit 36,000. Probably. You know, just watch'') in order to      claim vindication now.       Former Reagan domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett just      called Glassman a ``nitwit'' and left it at that.       All of which leads to an obvious point: although we      recognize that the long-term trend of the stock market is      that it has an overall upward trajectory--punctuated in      snapshots by the susurrations of the greed/fear cycle--it is      nevertheless catnip for a lot of wild-eyed prognosticators,      and the over-reliance of using the stock market as evidence      of economic recovery, or the proof of economic fundamentals,      is acute.       So what does it say about the Dow that it could hit this      dizzying new height--impressive by any measure in any era,      post-crash or otherwise--at a time when the overall global      economic outlook is so dismal and the domestic recovery is      barely felt by the citizens who sacrificed their capital to      save the world from calamity?       It says that we should be gravely concerned. It says that      we have a two-tiered economy, one where profits flow and      another where risks lurk. It says that a lot of people are      being left behind, and if October 2007 is any guide, it says      that this display of prosperity may simply be an illusion.       The distribution of the stock market's largesse has been      the most un-egalitarian aspect of American economics for      years. A full 50 percent of all capital gains go not to the      richest 1 percent of Americans, but to the richest 0.1      percent, according to The Washington Post.       But the stock market's persistent upward climb since the      spring of 2009 has revealed another massive disparity: the      multinational corporate machinery that generates stock gains      has become unmoored from the economic reality in which the      majority of Americans live and die.       The Dow hit its peak this week amid a host of gloomy global      economic forecasts. Back in January, the World Bank ``sharply      reduced its estimate of global economic growth in 2013,      projecting that the downturn in Europe and the United States'      fiscal problems will continue to weigh on investment and      spending.'' The World Bank's take on U.S. growth was      similarly dismal--its 1.9 percent forecast for the coming      year was less than the most pessimistic estimates of our own      Federal Reserve.",

        "statement": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Aliana Nicole Sonksen, a rising senior at Camdenton High School in Camdenton, Missouri, who won third place in the National Institute of Health's Addiction Science Competition. This prestigious award was given at the 2013 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.   The Intel International Science and Engineering Fair is the world's largest international science competition for high school students, and this year it provided a forum for approximately 1,500 students from 70 countries, regions, and territories to showcase their independent research. Since 2008, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has selected three projects to receive awards for exemplary work in addiction science, and I am extremely proud that a winning project came from the hard work and dedication of one of my constituents.   Ms. Sonksen's project, ``Determining the Behavioral and Physiological Effects of Pentedrone-Based Bath Salts on Drosophila Melangaster,'' studied the effects of two versions of the drugs called ``bath salts'' on the common fruit fly. She looked at three possible effects: mortality, feeding patterns, and activity levels. Many of the flies died from exposure to bath salts, and many others decreased their feeding activity. Her research showed that the substances, while commonly considered stimulants, acted more like hallucinogens, with the flies appearing to be in a daze.   I am proud that Ms. Sonksen not only took the time and energy to submit an award winning project but also focused her efforts on such an important issue. Bath salts are emerging synthetic stimulants that often contain amphetamine-like chemicals. Addiction and abuse of these drugs has dramatically increased over the past few years and has resulted in a number of hospitalizations and even deaths. I appreciate the awareness Ms. Sonksen has raised to the issues surrounding bath salts through her research and submission of her project.   In closing, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring Aliana Sonksen's Addiction Science Award and her hopeful future of contributing to addiction science for many years to come.",

Brennan, who is largely responsible for America's      current flawed counterterrorism strategy, which relies too      heavy on drone strikes that frequently kills civilians and      provide al Qaeda with countless new recruits. Rather than      keeping us safe, this strategy is putting the United States      at greater risk.       For all of the Obama administration's foreign policy      successes--from ending the war in Iraq to killing Osama bin      Laden--the most enduring policy legacy of the past 4 years      may well turn out to be an approach to counterterrorism that      American officials call the Yemen model, a mixture of drone      strikes and Special Forces raids targeting al Qaeda leaders.       Mr. Brennan is the President's chief counterterrorism      adviser and the architect of this model. In a recent speech,      he claimed that there was ``little evidence that these      actions are generating widespread anti-American sentiment or      recruits for AQAP,'' referring to al Qaeda in the Arabian      Peninsula.",

        "statement": "A relatively unnoticed article by Associated Press reporter      Kimberly Dozier 2 weeks ago outlined new Obama administration      policy changes which consolidated power for authorizing drone      attacks and assassinations      under political appointees within the White House.       The article identifies White House Counterterrorism Chief      John Brennan as the official assuming the role of Obama's de      facto assassination czar, raising concerns even within the      Obama administration that the White House is increasingly      turning into ``a pseudo-military headquarters'' under the      direction of just a few senior Obama administration      officials.       Adding to these concerns are serious questions about      Brennan's qualification for this role.       Even before the 2008 election, eyebrows were raised over      Brennan's role in the Obama campaign. An employee of The      Analysis Corporation, of which Brennan was CEO, had      improperly accessed passport information for Hillary Clinton,      Obama's Democratic primary challenger at the time, and GOP      nominee John McCain. At the time, Brennan was a top adviser      to the Obama campaign, and Brennan's employee was not fired.      One of the key witnesses in the case was found murdered in      his car outside his church while the investigation was still      ongoing.       Brennan was involved in administration intrigue related to      the release of convicted Libyan Pan Am Flight 103 bomber from      a Scottish jail in August 2009. At the time of Megrahi's      release, when he returned to Libya to a national hero's      welcome, Brennan described the release as ``unfortunate,      inappropriate, and wrong'' and called for his reimprisonment.      However, Obama administration documents obtained by The      Sunday Times revealed that the White House had secretly      informed Scottish authorities that they found compassionate      release more palatable than the reimprisonment of Megrahi in      Libya.       Brennan also came under fire after would-be underwear      bomber Umar Farouk--and I won't try that last name--nearly      brought down a U.S.-bound Northwest Airlines flight on      Christmas Day 2009. British intelligence authorities had      notified their U.S. counterparts of an ``Umar Farouk''      meeting with al Qaeda cleric Anwar al Awlaki in Yemen, and      Umar Farouk's father had warned of his son's increasing      extremism to CIA officials at the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria.      However, Umar Farouk was never added to the U.S. no-fly list,      nor was his U.S. visa revoked.",

        "statement": "This afternoon at a White House ceremony, Obama announced      that his nominee for CIA Director will be `Jihad' John      Brennan, his current counterterrorism adviser.       Back in June, I profiled Brennan here at PJ Media. Some of      `Jihad' John's recent highlights include:       March 2008: John McCain's passport information leaked from      John Brennan's company during presidential campaign (key      witness murdered during investigation)       April 2008: Brennan tells the New York Times that US      government official must stop ``Iran-bashing''       Feb 2010: Brennan attacks critics of Obama Admin's handling      of ``underwear bomber'' Abdulmutallab as a criminal, not a      terrorist, saying that critics are ``serving the goals of Al-     Qaeda''       May 2010: Brennan says he wants to build up ``Hezbollah      moderates''       May 2010: Brennan defends `Jihad' as a `legitimate tenet of      Islam'       June 2010: Washington Times editorial slams Brennan,      saying, ``President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser      knows very little about terrorism, and that's scary for      America.''       Aug 2010: Brennan storms out of meeting with Washington      Times editorial staff after he claims he was misquoted by      newspaper and editor begins reading Brennan's own quotes back      to him out loud       Sept 2010: Known HAMAS operative given escorted tour of      National Counterterrorism Center       May 2012: Brennan implicated in major White House      intelligence breach involving UK/Saudi Al-Qaeda infiltrator       Aug 2012: Brennan attacks critics of politically-driven      White House intelligence leaks       Sept 2012: House Intel Committee Chairman Mike Rogers says      changes in CIA's Benghazi attack talking points blaming      Mohammed video happened under deputies committee chaired by      Brennan       Again, these are just some of John Brennan's highlights. We      could also add his laughable claims of no collateral      casualties from his drone assassination program or his      defense of trying Al-Qaeda operations chief Khalid Sheikh      Mohammed in federal court or his role in the White House      back-door dealing with the UK on the release of Libyan Pan Am      Flight 103 bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi or his reference to      Jerusalem as ``Al-Quds'' in a NYU speech or his claims that      the 20 percent recidivism rate for GITMO detainees (those who      returned to terrorism) was ``not that bad''. But that would      be piling on.       What should be clear is that John Brennan's role in Barack      Obama's disastrous first term should preclude him from any      further service in the second term, let alone a promotion.",

        "statement": "Washington.--American officials say they are seeing the      first evidence that dozens of fighters with Al Qaeda, and a      small handful of the terrorist group's leaders, are moving to      Somalia and Yemen from their principal haven in Pakistan's      tribal areas. In communications that are being watched      carefully at the Pentagon, the White House and the Central      Intelligence Agency, the terrorist groups in all three      locations are now communicating more frequently, and      apparently trying to coordinate their actions, the officials      said.       Some aides to President Obama attribute the moves to      pressure from intensified drone attacks against Qaeda      operatives in Pakistan, after years of unsuccessful American      efforts to dislodge the terrorist group from their haven      there.       But there are other possible explanations. Chief among them      is the growth of the jihadist campaigns in both Somalia and      Yemen, which may now have some of the same appeal for      militants that Iraq did after the American military invasion      there in 2003.       Somalia is now a failed state that bears some resemblance      to Afghanistan before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, while      Yemen's weak government is ineffectually trying to combat the      militants, American officials say.       The shift of fighters is still small, perhaps a few dozen,      and there is no evidence that the top leaders--Osama bin      Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri--are considering a move from their      refuge in the Pakistani tribal areas, according to more than      half a dozen senior administration, military and      counterterrorism officials interviewed in recent days.       Most officials would not comment on the record about the      details of what they are seeing, because of the sensitivity      of the intelligence information they are gathering.       Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director, said in remarks here      on Thursday that the United States must prevent Al Qaeda from      creating a new sanctuary in Yemen or Somalia.       The steady trickle of fighters from Pakistan could worsen      the chaos in Somalia, where an Islamic militant group, the      Shabab, has attracted hundreds of foreign jihadists in its      quest to topple the weak moderate Islamist government in      Mogadishu. It could also swell the ranks of a growing menace      in Yemen, where militants now control large areas of the      country outside the capital.       ``I am very worried about growing safe havens in both      Somalia and Yemen, specifically because we have seen Al Qaeda      leadership, some leaders, start to flow to Yemen,'' Adm. Mike      Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in      remarks at the Brookings Institution here on May 18.       For the United States, the movement creates opportunities      as well as risks. With the Obama administration focusing its      fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda on the havens in      Afghanistan and Pakistan, a shift of fighters and some      leaders to new locations could complicate American efforts to      strike a lasting blow.       But in the tribal areas of Pakistan, Qaeda and Taliban      forces have drawn for protection on Pashtun tribes with whom      they have deep familial and tribal ties. A move away from      those areas could expose Qaeda leaders to betrayal, while      communications among militants in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen      have      created a new opportunity for American intelligence to zero      in on insurgents who gave up many electronic communication      devices shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks to avoid      detection.       A senior Obama administration official attributed some of      the movement to ``the enormous heat we've been putting on the      leadership and the mid-ranks'' with Predator strikes,      launched from both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Mr. Obama's      strategy so far has been to intensify many of the strikes      begun under the Bush administration.       ``There are indications that some Al Qaeda terrorists are      starting to see the tribal areas of Pakistan as a tough place      to be,'' said an American counterterrorism official. ``It is      likely that a small number have left the region as a result.      Among these individuals, some have probably ended up in      Somalia and Yemen, among other places. The Al Qaeda      terrorists who are leaving the tribal areas of Pakistan are      predominantly foot soldiers.''       Measuring the numbers of these movements is almost as      difficult as assessing the motivations of those who are on      their way out of the tribal areas.       But American officials say there is evidence of a shift.      One senior American military official who follows Africa      closely said that more than 100 foreign fighters had trained      in terrorism camps in Somalia alone in the past few years.      Another senior military officer said that Qaeda operatives      and confederates in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia had stepped      up communications with one another.       ``What really has us worried is that they're communicating      with each other much more--Al Qaeda in Pakistan, Somalia and      Yemen,'' the senior military officer said. ``They're asking,      `What do you need? Financing? Fighters?' ''       Mr. Obama's strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan placed      the defeat of Al Qaeda as the No. 1 objective, largely to      make sure that the group could not plot new attacks against      the United States.       Thus, the movement of the fighters, and the disruption that      causes, has been interpreted by some of the president's top      advisers as a sign of success.       But the emergence of new havens, from which Al Qaeda and      its affiliates could plot new attacks, raises difficult      questions for the United States on how to combat the growing      threat, and creates the possibility that increased missile      strikes are in the offing in Yemen and Somalia.       ``Those are issues that I think the international community      is going to have to address because Al Qaeda is not going      away,'' Admiral Mullen told a Senate committee on May 21.       The C.I.A. says its drone attacks in Pakistan have      disrupted Al Qaeda's operations and damaged the group's      senior ranks. American officials say that strikes have killed      11 of the top 20 Qaeda leaders in the past year.       ``Al Qaeda has been hit by drones and it has generated a      lot of insecurity among them,'' said Talat Masood, a retired      Pakistani general and military analyst in Islamabad.       ``Many among them are uneasy and it is possible that they      are leaving for Somalia and other jihadi battle fronts,'' he      said. ``The hard core, however, will like to stay on.''       Without singling out any countries, Adm. Eric T. Olson, the      head of the Special Operations Command, spoke in general      terms last week about how the increased Pakistani military      operations in the Swat Valley and early indications of a new      Pakistani offensive in South Waziristan had put militants on      the run.       ``As the Pakistanis are applying pressure,'' Admiral Olson      told a House panel, ``it will shift some of the sanctuaries      to other places.''",

        "statement": "Sen. Rand Paul has an op-ed in the New York Times today      opposing the nomination of David J. Barron to the U.S. Court      of Appeals for the First Circuit until the memos Barron wrote      concerning the legality of the targeted killing of US citizen      Anwar Al-Awlaki are publically released. The ACLU has also      urged that Barron's nomination be delayed until Senators are      allowed to read all targeted killing memos written by Barron.      I have been as much a critic of the drones program as Sen.      Paul, and have written often about my critiques of both the      apparent scope of the program and the lack of transparency      surrounding it. (See here, here  here). I continue to      support transparency. But it would be a terrible mistake to      hold up David Barron's nomination over this issue.       First, and most importantly, it is a mistake to conflate      the issues of the appointment of David Barron and disclosure      of the memos. Barron is a highly qualified lawyer who I know      personally to be thoughtful, considerate, open-minded, and      brilliant. His confirmation would put in place a judge who      will be absolutely vigilant in his protection of civil      liberties and his insistence that executive power be      constrained by the rule of law. That long-term value should      not be sacrificed because of a short-term battle over memos      that every Senator already has the opportunity to review.       There can be no doubt that Barron would be an excellent      independent judge, and would faithfully exercise his      authority to protect Americans' rights and to keep government      honest and constrained. As former judge and now Stanford Law      Professor Michael McConnell has noted, Barron ``has supported      efforts to adopt laws to enable judicial review of executive      actions that might otherwise escape judicial review because      of lack of standing, and has written powerfully about the      need for constitutional limits on executive excesses.''      Indeed, as head of the Office of Legal Counsel in 2009,      Barron himself withdrew five OLC memos written during the      prior administration to authorize controversial interrogation      techniques such as waterboarding. And fellow Harvard Law      Professor John F. Manning, a conservative who clerked for      Judge Robert Bork and Justice Antonin Scalia, has accurately      described Barron as ``undeniably brilliant'' and ``an      unusually talented and careful lawyer'' who will ``understand      and faithfully carry out the duties of a circuit judge.''       Second, the administration has in fact made available to      all Senators any and all memos Barron wrote concerning the      targeting of al-Awlaki--the core of the issue Sen. Paul is      concerned about. So if Sen. Paul and any other Senator want      to review Barron's reasoning in full, they are free to do so.      Moreover, the administration also made available to the      Senate, and ultimately to the public, a ``White Paper'' said      to be drawn from the Barron memo (though written long after      he left office). Thus, no Senator need be in the dark about      the Administration's reasoning, and the public also has a      pretty good idea as well.       Indeed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit      recently ruled that a redacted version of the al-Awlaki memo      can and should be disclosed, largely because much of its      reasoning had already been made public in the White Paper.      Thus, while I fully support the public disclosure of the      memo, redacted to protect sources and methods, every Senator      already has full access to the memo, and therefore can make      an informed judgment on advice and consent. And the public      also has a good sense of what it says.       Notably, Senators Ron Wyden, Mark Udall, and Martin      Heinrich, all members of the Intelligence Committee, wrote a      letter to Attorney General Eric Holder in November 2013,      after reviewing the memo on the killing of al-Awlaki, and      stating their view the killing was ``a legitimate use of the      authority granted to the President.'' They went on to urge      the administration to be more forthcoming about the legal      limits on the use of force against U.S. persons in other      cases, beyond what the memo apparently had sanctioned, but      did not question the legality of the action authorized.       Sen. Paul's op-ed notes that the Office of Legal Counsel      may have written more than one memo on targeted killing,      which is quite possible. But the administration has disclosed      to the Senators the full, unredacted versions of any memo      authorizing the killing of Americans, the issue Sen. Paul      raises in his op-ed.       Finally, holding up Barron's nomination is unlikely to      expedite disclosure of the memos. It will only undermine the      confirmation of someone who would make an excellent judge.      The Administration has been ordered (unanimously) to release      the memo, and will in short order either comply with that      order or seek further review. Barron has no control over that      decision, and should not be held hostage to it.       I am second to none in my support for transparency. And I      will continue to fight for that value on its own terms. But      it is a huge mistake to let our legitimate concerns about      transparency get in the way of the confirmation of a judge      who will faithfully protect our liberties and hold government      accountable--especially when the Senate already has been      given access to all the information they need to exercise      their ``advise and consent'' role. As a civil libertarian and      drone critic, I have no hesitation in saying that David      Barron should be confirmed.",

        "statement": "American journalist Paul Klebnikov was shot to death      outside my office building on Friday. At least it used to be      my office. I worked with Klebnikov, Forbes magazine's      maverick correspondent, several times in the past 10 years,      sometimes in Moscow, sometimes in New York. Our paths crossed      often through one of Russia's wildest decades.       Eight years after we first met as he covered Boris      Yeltsin's 1996 presidential election, his murder brings      clarity: Nothing has changed. Brutal criminals still run amok      in Russia, operating with impunity and no fear of      prosecution.       Klebnikov had high hopes for Russia and was determined to      urge democracy along. He grew up in the United States,      cradled in the close-knit Russian American community; his      Russian skills were perfect and his devotion to the culture      ran deep. He blossomed in journalism just as the communist      bloc crumbled, and his unique understanding of ``the story''      in the region propelled his career.       As we toured the Russian countryside eight years ago, he      talked to peasants waiting in line to vote and grilled me      with questions, too. Had I run across billionaire Boris      Berezovsky in my work with the Yeltsin administration? I      hadn't. Klebnikov had recently been scratching the surface of      Berezovsky's brazen get-rich-quick schemes. He was convinced      there was much more to the oligarch. He was in town to      investigate him as well as to cover the elections.       Berezovsky was one of several super-wealthy men who had      back doors to Yeltsin's Kremlin. His popularity waxed and      waned, but as he amassed wealth he gained unparalleled power.      Experienced expatriates in Russia shared an essential rule:      Don't cross these brutal billionaires, ever, or you're likely      to go home in a box.       Klebnikov knew this well. In Russia the mafia kills every      day. He knew Paul Tatum, the Oklahoma entrepreneur who ran      afoul of Moscow's mafia and was shot dead just a few hundred      yards from a hotel he had founded and had fought against      Mayor Yuri Luzhkov to control. After Tatum's murder, Hizzoner      promised swift justice. We're still waiting.       Tatum had led a loud life in Moscow. Klebnikov told me he      knew Tatum's battle with city ``authorities'' was never a      sound strategy for survival. The Tatum murder shook him, but      he was determined to go forward with what grew into a series      of articles exposing Russian corruption. After all, he was a      reporter, not a businessman.       As a journalist, Klebnikov was the real deal. He was based      in New York through the 1990s but had more contacts in Moscow      than most reporters on the ground full time. During his      frequent trips to the region he accomplished more meetings      before lunch than many of us could pull off in a week.       Klebnikov listened as intently to the griping of a      pensioner as he did to the drone of politicians. He was quick      to the point, wasted no time, and drove to the center of his      story like a tank. Some thought he was bold,      others thought him brash, but everyone was reading.       ``Godfather of the Kremlin,'' his December 1996 Forbes      cover story on Berezovsky, threw new light on the doings of      Russia's oligarchs. The story grew into Klebnikov's first      book, with the same title, published in 2001. The exiled      industrialist took the magazine to court in London, and      eventually Forbes recanted accusations of violence. Those of      us who lived in Moscow during Berezovsky's heyday still      believe.       His follow-up stories on Russian industrialists were always      fair and thorough, but he didn't make many friends in the      country. Soon after Vladimir Putin stepped into the      presidency, Klebnikov and I met in New York. I told him he      needed to watch his back with so much change afoot. He      shrugged and said he was uniquely positioned to get to the      heart of corruption in Russia. ``Who else is going to do      it?'' he asked. I had no answer.       When Forbes announced Klebnikov would lead its new Russian      publication and relocate to Moscow, I immediately feared for      his safety. A few months later he was dead. I think about      him, sprawled bleeding on the sidewalk, coughing his final      words to a reporter colleague who found him dying.       Russia hasn't changed in the past decade and at this      trajectory it won't be truly civilized for generations. Those      who killed Klebnikov are killing today, plan to kill      tomorrow, and know they'll roam free to kill for years to      come. Hellbent on getting rich, they have no boundaries.      Raised in a communist world devoid of morals, they have no      soul.       There is no valid reason why a nation so tolerant--even      complicit--in organized crime should stand on par with world      leaders in groups such as the World Trade Organization. Putin      must stand as the guarantor of media freedom. And the Bush      administration must demand results in this murder      investigation and require the assassins and their bosses be      detected, arrested, tried and punished to the fullest extent      of the law.       Or will it let Paul Klebnikov, like Paul Tatum, be just      another footnote in Russia's disingenuous flirtation with      world-class rule of law? We're waiting.",

By calling them bath salts, manufacturers are trying to deliberately mislead people into thinking they are an everyday product. It is despicable when young kids--14, 15, 16 years old--try bath salts and they think it is harmless. These dangerous drugs are sold in convenience stores and smoke shops for as little as $14 to $40. And what are their names? Tranquility, Zoom, White Lightning, and Hurricane Charlie. These so-called bath salts or plant foods are nothing more than deadly narcotics, and they are being sold cheaply to all comers with no questions asked at store counters around the country. How is it possible that such deadly drugs are legal? Because by marketing them as bath salts, which aren't for human consumption, they aren't regulated. These bath salts have much the same effects, according to users, as cocaine or ecstasy, but they are preferred because they are cheaper and more readily accessible. In fact, according to court papers obtained by the Staten Island Advance, one of our fine local papers in New York, a seller in Brooklyn boasted to a Federal agent that the bath salts would deliver a better high than cocaine.",

        "statement": "Dear Mr. Chairman: The legislation you have proposed to      update and clarify the Authorization for the Use of Military      Force (``AUMF''), passed in September 2001 in the wake of the      attacks on the United States that occurred that month, is      both timely and constructive.       Since its passage, the AUMF has not been updated to reflect      the evolving nature and origin of the Islamist threat against      this country. Indeed, there are organizations, including the      Pakistani Taliban, that are arguably not within its reach,      and although we have fought and detained thousands of enemy      fighters captured not only in Afghanistan and Iraq, but also      in Somalia, Yemen and Pakistan, and continue to detain      hundreds, the AUMF does not even refer to detention, let      alone prescribe standards for detention. As a result of this      inaction, we have simply allowed policy makers and judges to      improvise how we deal with the evolving terrorist threat and      how we treat those we encounter on the battlefield. The      increased use of remotely piloted aircraft--drones--has      allowed us to strike lethally, but because dead men tell no      tales and records destroyed in drone attacks cannot be      exploited, we may unconsciously be defaulting toward      strategies that do not allow us to act as effectively as we      might if we captured terrorists instead of killing them.       Your new legislation would not confer new powers, but      rather would add order and rationality to what has been an      improvisational exercise overseen by judges who do not have      the fact-finding resources of Congress, or the accountability      that comes from being responsible for protecting the national      security.       I cannot for the life of me understand the opposition to      this measure that is coming from people who profess to be      concerned with civil liberties and the rule of law, and yet      seem to prefer an improvisational arrangement that does not      make us face up to the fact that we are detaining people. If      anything, such a system creates the occasion for offloading      our detention responsibility to countries that will treat      detainees much less humanely than we would, or killing      instead of capturing, which can hardly be said to present a      humane alternative or one governed by legal principles.       I would welcome the opportunity to provide whatever help      and input I can.           Yours sincerely,                                               Michael B. Mukasey.",

As in the case of Harzi, as demonstrated, this approach is fraught with diplomatic roadblocks, costing critical time in getting information from suspects to track terrorist networks. Perhaps that is why President Obama so often opts to use lethal drone strikes to kill terrorists, knowing that the U.S. would be unable to get access to interrogate these terror suspects by working through host governments or because he no longer has a way to detain them in U.S. custody short of providing them the full privileges of an article III court.",

A day earlier, in Lahore, a college student asked Clinton why every student who visits the U.S. is viewed as a terrorist. The opinions Clinton heard weren't described in voices of radical clerics or politicians with anti-U.S. agendas. Some of the most biting criticisms came from well-mannered university students and respected, seasoned journalists, a reflection of the breadth of dissatisfaction Pakistanis have with U.S. policies toward their country.''",

        "statement": "Kabul, Afghanistan.--Supporters of the Islamic State group      in Afghanistan are attempting to establish a regional base in      the eastern city of Jalalabad, the commander of U.S. and NATO      forces in Afghanistan, General John Campbell, said on      Tuesday.       In an interview with The Associated Press, Campbell said      that ``foreign fighters'' from Syria and Iraq had joined      Afghans who had declared loyalty to the group in the eastern      province of Nangarhar, bordering Pakistan.       He said there were also ``indications'' that the IS      supporters in Nangarhar were trying to consolidate links with      the group's leadership in Syria and Iraq.       The Islamic State group controls about a third of Iraq and      Syria. Fighters loyal to the group in Afghanistan include      disaffected Afghan and Pakistani Taliban who have fought      fierce battles with the Taliban in recent months.       Afghan officials have said that IS supporters control a      number of border districts in Nangarhar and have a presence      in some other southern provinces, including Zabul and Ghazni.       Until now, however, it was unclear whether loyalists in      Afghanistan had institutional links to the group's      leadership.       Many of those who had declared allegiance to IS were      ``disenfranchised Taliban'' from both sides of the border,      Campbell said. But, he added, ``they've been reaching out.      I'm sure there are folks who have come from Syria and Iraq--I      couldn't tell you how many but there are indications of some      foreign fighters coming in there.       ``But they don't have the capability right now to attack      Europe, or attack the homeland, the United States. But that's      what they want to do, they've said that's what they want to      do,'' he said.       During the summer months, Taliban and IS loyalists fought      fierce battles in the far eastern districts of Nangarhar,      with residents reporting a range of atrocities, including      arbitrary imprisonment, forced marriages for young women, and      beheadings.       The IS loyalists have said they want to absorb Afghanistan      into a larger province of its ``caliphate'' called Khorasan.      Campbell said the group wants to establish a base in      Nangarhar's provincial capital, Jalalabad ``as the base of      the Khorasan province'' and ``work their way up into Kunar''      province immediately north.       The first credible reports of an IS presence in Afghanistan      emerged earlier this year in northern Helmand, though      recruiters believed to have had links to the leadership in      Syria were killed by U.S. drone strikes in February.       The presence in Nangarhar became clear in the summer, when      IS loyalists launched battles against the Taliban in the      border regions. For months, the Afghan forces--occupied with      fighting elsewhere--had let the two groups fight each other,      Campbell said. ``If the Taliban and ISIL want to kill each      other, let them do it,'' he said, using an alternative      acronym for the Islamic State group.       He said that control of the four districts--Achin, Nazyan,      Bati Kot and Spin Gar--had seesawed between the two groups.       The revelation in July that the Taliban's founder and      leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar had been dead for more than two      years has led to deep fissures in the leadership, and      infighting between rival Taliban factions that Campbell said      had left hundreds dead.       Campbell, who took control of U.S. and NATO forces in      Afghanistan in mid-2014, said splits among the Taliban, who      have been trying to overthrow the Afghan government since      their regime was driven from power in 2001 by the U.S.      invasion, could make the fight even harder in 2016.       ``The prize really is Kandahar, that's their strategic      goal,'' he said, referring to the southern province from      where the Taliban emerged after Afghanistan's vicious civil      war ended in 1996.       Neighboring Helmand province, where most of the world's      opium is produced, is currently the scene of fierce battles      for control of strategically important districts, including      Marjah.       Taliban fighters took control of the northern city of      Kunduz in September, for just three days before the Afghan      military, backed by U.S. forces, pushed them out.       Campbell said he did not believe the Taliban had planned to      hold or govern Kunduz, but the psychological impact of the      city's fall had been enormous. Jalalabad, he said, ``is not      going to fall.''       Afghan forces, ``challenged in many areas, understand the      impact of Kunduz,'' he said. ``I think they will make the      right adjustments so that it (Jalalabad) doesn't become      another Kunduz.''",

At less than 30 pounds, it has flown on both manned and unmanned aircraft proving its ability to accurately detect at extended ranges while on the move. The Army Aviation Center is ready to integrate this technology on both manned and unmanned aircraft to provide both enhanced targeting and aircrew survivability. In concert with AMRDEC (Huntsville), PM UAV (Huntsville) and the Directorate of Combat Developments (Ft.

        "statement": "House Republican Leader John Boehner, the Ohio Republican      with his eye on Speaker Nancy Pelosi's gavel, said the tide      is turning the GOP's way.       ``The American people have written off the Democrats,''      Boehner said Monday in an interview with Tribune-Review      editors and reporters. ``They're willing to look at us      again.''       Boehner stopped short of predicting Republicans would gain      the 39 seats they need to retake control of Congress, but he      said a backlash against President Obama's policies has      energized Republican voters more than Democrats. Boehner said      voters are angry at a government they believe is overreaching      and indifferent.       University of Virginia political scientist Isaac Wood said      excitement among tea party protesters might not carry over to      the electorate as a whole.       ``While the enthusiasm of tea party types may drive them to      the polls and boost Republicans, it does not yet seem that      huge waves of new voters will be flocking to the polls,''      Wood said.       Boehner said the protests are emblematic of deep voter      anger against Washington's leaders.       ``They're snuffing out the America that I grew up in,''      Boehner said. ``Right now, we've got more Americans engaged      in their government than at any time in our history. There's      a political rebellion brewing, and I don't think we've seen      anything like it since 1776.''       The health care law passed in March ``pushed most Americans      over the edge,'' Boehner said.       If Republicans retake control of the House, Boehner      promised a vote on a bill repealing the health care law and      replacing it with a scaled-down package of tax breaks and      court reforms. Democrats likely would maintain control of the      Senate, and Obama could veto the proposal, all but      eliminating its chances of succeeding.       ``We are going to do everything we can to make sure that      this law and this program never really takes effect,''      Boehner said. One option would be to repeal the $534 billion      in Medicare cuts, which pay for more than half of the law's      provisions. ``They're going to need money from the Congress      to hire these 20,000-plus bureaucrats they need to hire to      make this program work. They're not going to get one dime      from us.''       Boehner criticized the financial regulatory overhaul      compromise reached last week between House and Senate      negotiators as an overreaction to the financial crisis that      triggered the recession. The bill would tighten restrictions      on lending, create a consumer protection agency with broad      oversight power and give the government an orderly way to      dissolve the largest financial institutions if they run out      of money.       ``This is killing an ant with a nuclear weapon,'' Boehner      said. What's most needed is more transparency and better      enforcement by regulators, he said.       Allan H. Meltzer, a political economy professor at Carnegie      Mellon University, said the financial bill ``does nothing to      restore integrity to the mortgage market by correcting Fannie      Mae and Freddie Mac, and the bill does not eliminate `too big      to fail.' ''       Boehner said Obama overreacted to the BP oil spill in the      Gulf of Mexico. The spill might warrant a ``pause'' in      deepwater drilling, but Obama's blanket ban on drilling in      the gulf--which a judge overturned last week--could devastate      the region's economy, he said. Louisiana State University      scientists estimate the ban could have affected more than      10,000 jobs.       Boehner had praise, however, for Obama's troop surge in      Afghanistan and stepped-up drone attacks in Pakistan. He      declined to list any benchmarks he has for measuring progress      in the nine-year war, at a time of increasing violence and      Obama's replacement of Gen. Stanley McChrystal with Gen.      David Petraeus.       Ensuring there's enough money to pay for the war will      require reforming the country's entitlement system, Boehner      said. He said he'd favor increasing the Social Security      retirement age to 70 for people who have at least 20 years      until retirement, tying cost-of-living increases to the      consumer price index rather than wage inflation and limiting      payments to those who need them.       ``We need to look at the American people and explain to      them that we're broke,'' Boehner said. ``If you have      substantial non-Social Security income while you're retired,      why are we paying you at a time when we're broke? We just      need to be honest with people.''",

When stationed at Nellis Air Force Base a second time, he commanded the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing. With 26 squadrons, consisting of A-10, B-1, B-52, F-15C/D, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16C/D, HH-60G and the RQ-1A Predator, it is the Air Force's largest, most diverse flying wing. The 57th also included the Air Force Weapons School, Red Flag, Air Force Aggressors, the Air Force Demonstration Squadron ``The Thunderbirds'', the Air-Ground Operations School, Air Warrior, 66th Rescue Squadron and the Predator unmanned aerial vehicle operations.",

While I cannot legally share such classified material publicly, I can frankly and honestly state that my review of said material has wholly convinced me that Saddam Hussein's military regime poses a grave threat to the safety and security of American citizens, including here at home. There is compelling evidence of Iraq's biological and chemical capabilities and Saddam Hussein's intended use of such weapons. There is also strong evidence of his pursuit of nuclear weapons. Of significant concern is Iraq's growing fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are capable of dispensing biological or chemical weapons. As President Bush stated in his recent address to the Nation, our intelligence information indicates that Saddam Hussein is ``exploring ways of using these UAVs for missions targeting the United States.''",

        "statement": "Klebnikov knew this well. In Russia the mafia kills every      day. He knew Paul Tatum, the Oklahoma entrepreneur who ran      afoul of Moscow's mafia and was shot dead just a few hundred      yards from a hotel he had founded and had fought against      Mayor Yuri Luzhkov to control. After Tatum's murder. Hizzoner      promised swift justice. We're still waiting.        Tatum had led a loud life in Moscow. Klebnikov told me he      knew Tatum's battle with city ``authorities'' was never a      sound strategy for survival. The Tatum murder shook him, but      he was determined to go forward with what grew into a series      of articles exposing Russian corruption. After all, he was a      reporter, not a businessman.        As a journalist, Klebnikov was the real deal. He was based      in New York through the 1990s but had more contacts in Moscow      than most reporters on the ground full time.       During his frequent trips to the region he accomplished      more meetings before lunch than many of us could pull off in      a week.       Klebnikov listened as intently to the griping of a      pensioner as he did to the drone of politicians. He was quick      to the point, wasted no time, and drove to the center of his      story like a tank. Some thought he was bold, others thought      him brash, but everyone was reading.       ``Godfather of the Kremlin,'' his December 1996 Forbes      cover story on Berezovsky, threw new light on the doings of      Russia's oligarchs. The story grew into Klebnikov's first      book,      with the same title, published in 2001. The exiled      industrialist took the magazine to court in London, and      eventually Forbes recanted accusations of violence. Those of      us who lived in Moscow during Berezovsky's heyday still      believe.       His follow-up stories on Russian industrialists were always      fair and thorough, but he didn't make many friends in the      country. Soon after Vladimir Putin stepped into the      presidency, Klebnikov and I met in New York. I told him he      needed to watch his back with so much change afoot. He      shrugged and said he was uniquely positioned to get to the      heart of corruption in Russia. ``Who else is going to do      it?'' he asked. I had no answer.       When Forbes announced Klebnikov would lead its new Russian      publications and relocate to Moscow, I immediately feared for      his safety. A few months later he was dead. I think about      him, sprawled bleeding on the sidewalk, coughing his final      words to a reporter colleague who found him dying.       Russia hasn't changed in the past decade and at this      trajectory it won't be truly civilized for generations. Those      who killed Klebnikov are killing today, plan to kill      tomorrow, and know they'll roam free to kill for years to      come. Hellbent on getting rich, they have no boundaries.      Raised in a communist world devoid of morals, they have no      soul.       There is no valid reason why a nation so tolerant--even      complicit--in organized crime should stand on par with world      leaders in groups such as the World Trade Organization. Putin      must stand as the guarantor of media freedom. And the Bush      administration must demand results in this murder      investigation and require the assassins and their bosses be      detected, arrested, tried and punished to the fullest extent      of the law.       Or will it let Paul Klebnikov, like Paul Tatum, be just      another footnote in Russia's disingenuous flirtation with      world-class rule of law? We're waiting.",

On September 30, 2015, the Simpson, which is the last active Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate, will be decommissioned and leave the active United States Navy fleet.   The Simpson is named for Rear Admiral Rodger W. Simpson (1898-1964), who was a distinguished officer during World War II. RADM Simpson was awarded the Navy Cross, Silver Star and Legion of Merit for rescuing and evacuating more than 7,500 Allied prisoners of war and civilians interned in Japanese concentration camps. The USS Simpson was commissioned on November 9, 1985.    From its first overseas deployment, the USS Simpson and her crew have distinguished themselves in combat. On April 18, 1988, along with two other navy ships, the Simpson responded to the Iranian mine attack on the USS Samuel B. Roberts by destroying an Iranian oil platform and sinking the Iranian Navy mission patrol combatant, Joshan.   Over her 30 years of service, the Simpson made 14 deployments. Her final deployment was for seven months to the U.S. 5th and 6th Fleet areas of operation in which she conducted theater security cooperation exercises. As in the past, the crew was called on to support various task forces and performed perfectly never missing an operational commitment. Every sailor made a difference every day. In addition, some of the newest technologies in the Navy were aboard, four Fire Scouts (MQ-8B) vertical takeoff and landing tactical unmanned aerial vehicles.   The crew on the last deployment was comprised of reservists as well as active duty individual augmented personnel with zero previous experience with UAV's. Despite the challenges, the officers aboard reported the crew achieved the highest ever recorded maintenance readiness and sortie completion rate of any Fire Scout deployment in the program's history.   The Simpson will be decommissioned but the friendships and camaraderie this ship established on its decks will last for ages. It is a pleasure and honor to represent the great men and women who serve in the 4th Congressional District of Florida and to see them successfully complete the mission of the USS Simpson. Their hard work and dedication contributes to the important missions of our Nation's defense and reiterates our community's importance as an anchor of national security.",

        "statement": "If your concern about the threat posed by the Tsarnaev      brothers is limited to assuring that they will never be in a      position to repeat their grisly acts, rest easy.       The elder, Tamerlan--apparently named for the 14th-century      Muslim conqueror famous for building pyramids of his victims'      skulls to commemorate his triumphs over infidels--is dead.      The younger, Dzhokhar, will stand trial when his wounds heal,      in a proceeding where the most likely uncertainty will be the      penalty. No doubt there will be some legal swordplay over his      interrogation by the FBI's High-Value Interrogation Group      without receiving Miranda warnings. But the only downside for      the government in that duel is that his statements may not be      used against him at trial. This is not much of a risk when      you consider the other available evidence, including photo      images of him at the scene of the bombings and his own      reported confession to the victim whose car he helped hijack      during last week's terror in Boston.       But if your concern is over the larger threat that inheres      in who the Tsarnaev brothers were and are, what they did, and      what they represent, then worry--a lot.       For starters, you can worry about how the High-Value      Interrogation Group, or HIG, will do its work. That unit was      finally put in place by the FBI after so-called ``underwear      bomber'' named Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to blow up the      airplane in which he was traveling as it flew over Detroit on      Christmas Day in 2009 and was advised of his Miranda rights.      The CIA interrogation program that might have handled the      interview had by then been dismantled by President Obama.       At the behest of such Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated groups      as the Council on American Islamic Relations and the Islamic      Society of North America and other self-proclaimed spokesmen      for American Muslims, the FBI has bowdlerized its training      materials to exclude references to militant Islamism. Does      this delicacy infect the FBI's interrogation group as well?       Will we see another performance like the Army's after-     action report following Major Nidal Hasan's rampage at Fort      Hood in November 2009, preceded by his shout ``allahu      akhbar''--a report that spoke nothing of militant Islam but      referred to the incident as ``workplace violence''? If tone      is set at the top, recall that the Army chief of staff at the      time said the most tragic result of Fort Hood would be if it      interfered with the Army's diversity program.       Presumably, the investigation into the Boston terror attack      will include inquiry into not only the immediate      circumstances of the crimes but also who funded Tamerlan      Tsarnaev's months-long sojourn abroad in 2012 and his      comfortable lifestyle. Did he have a support network? What      training did he, and perhaps his younger brother, receive in      the use of weapons? Where did the elder of the two learn to      make the suicide vest he reportedly wore? The investigation      should include, as well, a deep dive into Tamerlan's      radicalization, the Islamist references in the brothers'      social media communications, and the jihadist Web sites they      visited.       Will the investigation probe as well the FBI's own      questioning of Tamerlan 2 years ago at the behest of an      unspecified foreign government, presumably Russia, over his      involvement with jihadist Web sites and other activities?      Tamerlan Tsarnaev is the fifth person since 9/11 who has      participated in terror attacks after questioning by the FBI.      He was preceded by Nidal Hasan; drone casualty Anwar al-     Awlaki; Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad--born Carlos Leon      Bledsoe--who murdered an Army recruit in Little Rock in June      2009; and David Coleman Headley, who provided intelligence to      the perpetrators of the Mumbai massacre in 2008. That doesn't      count Abdulmutallab, who was the subject of warnings to the      CIA that he was a potential terrorist.",

        "statement": "Spring budget season is almost over, and the House and      Senate have once again placed parochial politics above budget      discipline in their consideration of the Pentagon budget. The      most extreme example came in the House version of the      National Defense Authorization Act, which rejected virtually      every cost-cutting measure put forward by the Pentagon, from      base closings to retiring unneeded weapons systems. If the      House's actions aren't reversed, they would bust the current      budget caps to the tune of $50 billion over the next five      years.       There was one place the House authorizers were willing to      cut way back: a program designed to help communities adjust      to defense downsizings. This is particularly ill-advised at a      time when the Pentagon budget has been set on a path to come      down from a war-time buildup that brought it to its highest      levels since World War II.       While modest by historical terms, the defense build-down      that is now underway will demand adjustments in the      unrealistic spending plans Congress continues to authorize      for the Pentagon. And the cuts that are coming will have      impacts in scores of communities across the country.       Since the 1970s a small office within the Pentagon, the      Office of Economic Adjustment, has offered planning grants      and technical assistance to help these communities develop      their own strategies to capitalize on existing economic      strengths and adjust to postwar economic conditions. Once      these strategies are in place, the OEA serves as a point of      contact for impacted communities in accessing resources from      other federal agencies to help with implementation of their      plans. Just this week Ohio, Michigan and Indiana received a      grant of more than $2.4 million to fund a regional Defense      Manufacturing Assistance Program to address the loss of 3,900      defense-related jobs in those three states since 2012.       Most members of Congress want to base their judgments on      Pentagon spending on what is needed to defend the country.      But they also need to show defense-dependent communities,      businesses and workers in their states and districts that      they are watching out for their interests. The OEA's programs      give them a way to judge procurement spending accounts on      their merits,      while attending to the economic needs of their constituents.       Supporting the OEA does not mean that members of Congress      don't care about the existing jobs base. It just means that      they want in addition to have a Plan B in place in the event      of decisions that reduce Pentagon-related activities in their      areas.       It's troubling to watch the House voting to slash the OEA,      while standing firm in supporting costly, unneeded sacred      cows like the F-35 combat aircraft. Even slightly slowing the      pace of the F-35 program would pay for the OEA's programs      many times over.       The F-35--the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program      ever undertaken is--a poster child of waste. Current cost      estimates for building and maintaining the plane: roughly      $1.4 trillion over its lifetime. It has more than doubled in      price since it went into development, and it has had numerous      high profile failures, from cracked wings to unresolved      software problems. It is likely to perform many of its      assigned tasks less effectively than current generation      aircraft. An Air Force far superior to any other should be in      no rush to build over 2,400 F-35s.       The F-35 merely tops the House's list of unnecessary      expenditures. It rejected plans to delay the refueling of an      aircraft carrier at a savings of over $800 million--more than      ten times the cut proposed for the OEA. It attempts to block      the closure of excess military bases, stop the administration      from reducing the size of the Army, and prevent the Air Force      from retiring the U-2 spy plane, even as it funds Global Hawk      drones to do the same job. And the list goes on.       The common thread in all of these actions is a state of      denial about the trends in Pentagon spending. It will come      down this year, and under current law it will stabilize at      levels considerably lower than what the Pentagon's overly      ambitious plans will cost.       Funding programs that will help communities make the      transition to more diversified economies that can weather      reductions in Pentagon spending will make it easier to craft      budgets that put security concerns above pork barrel      politics. When the House and Senate put together a final      Pentagon budget proposal later this year, funding for OEA's      crucial programs should be restored.",

Russian      troops in eastern Ukraine are supporting these offensive      operations with command and control systems, air defense      systems with advanced surface-to-air missiles, unmanned      aerial systems, advanced multiple rocket launcher systems,      and electronic warfare systems.'';       Whereas, on January 25, 2015, after Russian-backed rebels      attacked Mariupol, European Council President Donald Tusk      wrote, ``Once again appeasement encourages the aggressor to      greater acts of violence; time to step up our policy based on      cold facts, not illusions.'';       Whereas, on November 19, 2014, at a Committee on Foreign      Relations of the Senate confirmation hearing, Deputy National      Security Adviser Anthony Blinken stated that the provision of      defensive lethal assistance to the Government of Ukraine      ``remains on the table.

I have some experience with being involved in missions where we had naval aviation assets, fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, working and communicating with naval ships, naval submarines, and not just in the United States but with our NATO allies. I will tell you, it is hard to do. We have different procedures and sometimes different languages, and it is difficult to coordinate our operations and our exercises. I think when you put together a coalition with 60 different nations and try to figure out how to work and coordinate what everybody is doing--some are providing air power, which is what we do. We have two carrier groups in this part of the world. One is over here in the Mediterranean Sea and the other is down here in the Persian Gulf. We are launching F-18s and F-16s off of those carriers, and we are still using B-52s, which are literally older than the P-3s I used to fly on in the Navy all those years ago. They are operating out of a variety of bases, including Qatar and other places, to do high-precision bombing against the ISIS forces. We are using drones and A-10 warthogs.
