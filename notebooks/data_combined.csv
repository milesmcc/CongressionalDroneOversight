1,1,,,0,,,0196132131e9c9e28a9882ad9020183e,,,-1,,SITUATION IN YEMEN,-1,,"Washington.--American officials say they are seeing the first evidence that dozens of fighters with Al Qaeda, and a small handful of the terrorist group's leaders, are moving to Somalia and Yemen from their principal haven in Pakistan's tribal areas. In communications that are being watched carefully at the Pentagon, the White House and the Central Intelligence Agency, the terrorist groups in all three locations are now communicating more frequently, and apparently trying to coordinate their actions, the officials said. Some aides to President Obama attribute the moves to pressure from intensified drone attacks against Qaeda operatives in Pakistan, after years of unsuccessful American efforts to dislodge the terrorist group from their haven there. But there are other possible explanations. Chief among them is the growth of the jihadist campaigns in both Somalia and Yemen, which may now have some of the same appeal for militants that Iraq did after the American military invasion there in 2003. Somalia is now a failed state that bears some resemblance to Afghanistan before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, while Yemen's weak government is ineffectually trying to combat the militants, American officials say. The shift of fighters is still small, perhaps a few dozen, and there is no evidence that the top leaders--Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri--are considering a move from their refuge in the Pakistani tribal areas, according to more than half a dozen senior administration, military and counterterrorism officials interviewed in recent days. Most officials would not comment on the record about the details of what they are seeing, because of the sensitivity of the intelligence information they are gathering. Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director, said in remarks here on Thursday that the United States must prevent Al Qaeda from creating a new sanctuary in Yemen or Somalia. The steady trickle of fighters from Pakistan could worsen the chaos in Somalia, where an Islamic militant group, the Shabab, has attracted hundreds of foreign jihadists in its quest to topple the weak moderate Islamist government in Mogadishu. It could also swell the ranks of a growing menace in Yemen, where militants now control large areas of the country outside the capital. ``I am very worried about growing safe havens in both Somalia and Yemen, specifically because we have seen Al Qaeda leadership, some leaders, start to flow to Yemen,'' Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in remarks at the Brookings Institution here on May 18. For the United States, the movement creates opportunities as well as risks. With the Obama administration focusing its fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda on the havens in Afghanistan and Pakistan, a shift of fighters and some leaders to new locations could complicate American efforts to strike a lasting blow. But in the tribal areas of Pakistan, Qaeda and Taliban forces have drawn for protection on Pashtun tribes with whom they have deep familial and tribal ties. A move away from those areas could expose Qaeda leaders to betrayal, while communications among militants in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen have created a new opportunity for American intelligence to zero in on insurgents who gave up many electronic communication devices shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks to avoid detection. A senior Obama administration official attributed some of the movement to ``the enormous heat we've been putting on the leadership and the mid-ranks'' with Predator strikes, launched from both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Mr. Obama's strategy so far has been to intensify many of the strikes begun under the Bush administration. ``There are indications that some Al Qaeda terrorists are starting to see the tribal areas of Pakistan as a tough place to be,'' said an American counterterrorism official. ``It is likely that a small number have left the region as a result. Among these individuals, some have probably ended up in Somalia and Yemen, among other places. The Al Qaeda terrorists who are leaving the tribal areas of Pakistan are predominantly foot soldiers.'' Measuring the numbers of these movements is almost as difficult as assessing the motivations of those who are on their way out of the tribal areas. But American officials say there is evidence of a shift. One senior American military official who follows Africa closely said that more than 100 foreign fighters had trained in terrorism camps in Somalia alone in the past few years. Another senior military officer said that Qaeda operatives and confederates in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia had stepped up communications with one another. ``What really has us worried is that they're communicating with each other much more--Al Qaeda in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen,'' the senior military officer said. ``They're asking, `What do you need? Financing? Fighters?' '' Mr. Obama's strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan placed the defeat of Al Qaeda as the No. 1 objective, largely to make sure that the group could not plot new attacks against the United States. Thus, the movement of the fighters, and the disruption that causes, has been interpreted by some of the president's top advisers as a sign of success. But the emergence of new havens, from which Al Qaeda and its affiliates could plot new attacks, raises difficult questions for the United States on how to combat the growing threat, and creates the possibility that increased missile strikes are in the offing in Yemen and Somalia. ``Those are issues that I think the international community is going to have to address because Al Qaeda is not going away,'' Admiral Mullen told a Senate committee on May 21. The C.I.A. says its drone attacks in Pakistan have disrupted Al Qaeda's operations and damaged the group's senior ranks. American officials say that strikes have killed 11 of the top 20 Qaeda leaders in the past year. ``Al Qaeda has been hit by drones and it has generated a lot of insecurity among them,'' said Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general and military analyst in Islamabad. ``Many among them are uneasy and it is possible that they are leaving for Somalia and other jihadi battle fronts,'' he said. ``The hard core, however, will like to stay on.'' Without singling out any countries, Adm. Eric T. Olson, the head of the Special Operations Command, spoke in general terms last week about how the increased Pakistani military operations in the Swat Valley and early indications of a new Pakistani offensive in South Waziristan had put militants on the run. ``As the Pakistanis are applying pressure,'' Admiral Olson told a House panel, ``it will shift some of the sanctuaries to other places.''",,0,111,,0,8/5/09,,,{u'FOREIGNPOLICY': u'ANTI'},1,,

He knew Paul Tatum, the Oklahoma entrepreneur who ran afoul of Moscow's mafia and was shot dead just a few hundred yards from a hotel he had founded and had fought against Mayor Yuri Luzhkov to control. After Tatum's murder. Hizzoner promised swift justice. We're still waiting. Tatum had led a loud life in Moscow. Klebnikov told me he knew Tatum's battle with city ``authorities'' was never a sound strategy for survival. The Tatum murder shook him, but he was determined to go forward with what grew into a series of articles exposing Russian corruption. After all, he was a reporter, not a businessman. As a journalist, Klebnikov was the real deal. He was based in New York through the 1990s but had more contacts in Moscow than most reporters on the ground full time. During his frequent trips to the region he accomplished more meetings before lunch than many of us could pull off in a week. Klebnikov listened as intently to the griping of a pensioner as he did to the drone of politicians. He was quick to the point, wasted no time, and drove to the center of his story like a tank. Some thought he was bold, others thought him brash, but everyone was reading. ``Godfather of the Kremlin,'' his December 1996 Forbes cover story on Berezovsky, threw new light on the doings of Russia's oligarchs. The story grew into Klebnikov's first book, with the same title, published in 2001. The exiled industrialist took the magazine to court in London, and eventually Forbes recanted accusations of violence. Those of us who lived in Moscow during Berezovsky's heyday still believe. His follow-up stories on Russian industrialists were always fair and thorough, but he didn't make many friends in the country. Soon after Vladimir Putin stepped into the presidency, Klebnikov and I met in New York. I told him he needed to watch his back with so much change afoot. He shrugged and said he was uniquely positioned to get to the heart of corruption in Russia. ``Who else is going to do it?'' he asked. I had no answer. When Forbes announced Klebnikov would lead its new Russian publications and relocate to Moscow, I immediately feared for his safety. A few months later he was dead. I think about him, sprawled bleeding on the sidewalk, coughing his final words to a reporter colleague who found him dying. Russia hasn't changed in the past decade and at this trajectory it won't be truly civilized for generations. Those who killed Klebnikov are killing today, plan to kill tomorrow, and know they'll roam free to kill for years to come. Hellbent on getting rich, they have no boundaries. Raised in a communist world devoid of morals, they have no soul. There is no valid reason why a nation so tolerant--even complicit--in organized crime should stand on par with world leaders in groups such as the World Trade Organization. Putin must stand as the guarantor of media freedom. And the Bush administration must demand results in this murder investigation and require the assassins and their bosses be detected, arrested, tried and punished to the fullest extent of the law. Or will it let Paul Klebnikov, like Paul Tatum, be just another footnote in Russia's disingenuous flirtation with world-class rule of law? We're waiting.",1,0,108,168,0,7/19/04,71,2,{u'': u''},0,799,

  CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS",0,MASSACH,"House Republican Leader John Boehner, the Ohio Republican with his eye on Speaker Nancy Pelosi's gavel, said the tide is turning the GOP's way. ``The American people have written off the Democrats,'' Boehner said Monday in an interview with Tribune-Review editors and reporters. ``They're willing to look at us again.'' Boehner stopped short of predicting Republicans would gain the 39 seats they need to retake control of Congress, but he said a backlash against President Obama's policies has energized Republican voters more than Democrats. Boehner said voters are angry at a government they believe is overreaching and indifferent. University of Virginia political scientist Isaac Wood said excitement among tea party protesters might not carry over to the electorate as a whole. ``While the enthusiasm of tea party types may drive them to the polls and boost Republicans, it does not yet seem that huge waves of new voters will be flocking to the polls,'' Wood said. Boehner said the protests are emblematic of deep voter anger against Washington's leaders. ``They're snuffing out the America that I grew up in,'' Boehner said. ``Right now, we've got more Americans engaged in their government than at any time in our history. There's a political rebellion brewing, and I don't think we've seen anything like it since 1776.'' The health care law passed in March ``pushed most Americans over the edge,'' Boehner said. If Republicans retake control of the House, Boehner promised a vote on a bill repealing the health care law and replacing it with a scaled-down package of tax breaks and court reforms. Democrats likely would maintain control of the Senate, and Obama could veto the proposal, all but eliminating its chances of succeeding. ``We are going to do everything we can to make sure that this law and this program never really takes effect,'' Boehner said. One option would be to repeal the $534 billion in Medicare cuts, which pay for more than half of the law's provisions. ``They're going to need money from the Congress to hire these 20,000-plus bureaucrats they need to hire to make this program work. They're not going to get one dime from us.'' Boehner criticized the financial regulatory overhaul compromise reached last week between House and Senate negotiators as an overreaction to the financial crisis that triggered the recession. The bill would tighten restrictions on lending, create a consumer protection agency with broad oversight power and give the government an orderly way to dissolve the largest financial institutions if they run out of money. ``This is killing an ant with a nuclear weapon,'' Boehner said. What's most needed is more transparency and better enforcement by regulators, he said. Allan H. Meltzer, a political economy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said the financial bill ``does nothing to restore integrity to the mortgage market by correcting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the bill does not eliminate `too big to fail.' '' Boehner said Obama overreacted to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The spill might warrant a ``pause'' in deepwater drilling, but Obama's blanket ban on drilling in the gulf--which a judge overturned last week--could devastate the region's economy, he said. Louisiana State University scientists estimate the ban could have affected more than 10,000 jobs. Boehner had praise, however, for Obama's troop surge in Afghanistan and stepped-up drone attacks in Pakistan. He declined to list any benchmarks he has for measuring progress in the nine-year war, at a time of increasing violence and Obama's replacement of Gen. Stanley McChrystal with Gen. David Petraeus. Ensuring there's enough money to pay for the war will require reforming the country's entitlement system, Boehner said. He said he'd favor increasing the Social Security retirement age to 70 for people who have at least 20 years until retirement, tying cost-of-living increases to the consumer price index rather than wage inflation and limiting payments to those who need them. ``We need to look at the American people and explain to them that we're broke,'' Boehner said. ``If you have substantial non-Social Security income while you're retired, why are we paying you at a time when we're broke? We just need to be honest with people.''",1,0,111,187,1,6/30/10,3,0,{u'REFERENCE': u'NEUTRAL'},1,965,

1,1,,,2,,,fc43a16cda6093339566d88c4de5177a,,,-1,,HIRE MORE HEROES ACT OF 2014--MOTION TO PROCEED,0,,"Sen. Rand Paul has an op-ed in the New York Times today opposing the nomination of David J. Barron to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit until the memos Barron wrote concerning the legality of the targeted killing of US citizen Anwar Al-Awlaki are publically released. The ACLU has also urged that Barron's nomination be delayed until Senators are allowed to read all targeted killing memos written by Barron. I have been as much a critic of the drones program as Sen. Paul, and have written often about my critiques of both the apparent scope of the program and the lack of transparency surrounding it. (See here, here here). I continue to support transparency. But it would be a terrible mistake to hold up David Barron's nomination over this issue. First, and most importantly, it is a mistake to conflate the issues of the appointment of David Barron and disclosure of the memos. Barron is a highly qualified lawyer who I know personally to be thoughtful, considerate, open-minded, and brilliant. His confirmation would put in place a judge who will be absolutely vigilant in his protection of civil liberties and his insistence that executive power be constrained by the rule of law. That long-term value should not be sacrificed because of a short-term battle over memos that every Senator already has the opportunity to review. There can be no doubt that Barron would be an excellent independent judge, and would faithfully exercise his authority to protect Americans' rights and to keep government honest and constrained. As former judge and now Stanford Law Professor Michael McConnell has noted, Barron ``has supported efforts to adopt laws to enable judicial review of executive actions that might otherwise escape judicial review because of lack of standing, and has written powerfully about the need for constitutional limits on executive excesses.'' Indeed, as head of the Office of Legal Counsel in 2009, Barron himself withdrew five OLC memos written during the prior administration to authorize controversial interrogation techniques such as waterboarding. And fellow Harvard Law Professor John F. Manning, a conservative who clerked for Judge Robert Bork and Justice Antonin Scalia, has accurately described Barron as ``undeniably brilliant'' and ``an unusually talented and careful lawyer'' who will ``understand and faithfully carry out the duties of a circuit judge.'' Second, the administration has in fact made available to all Senators any and all memos Barron wrote concerning the targeting of al-Awlaki--the core of the issue Sen. Paul is concerned about. So if Sen. Paul and any other Senator want to review Barron's reasoning in full, they are free to do so. Moreover, the administration also made available to the Senate, and ultimately to the public, a ``White Paper'' said to be drawn from the Barron memo (though written long after he left office). Thus, no Senator need be in the dark about the Administration's reasoning, and the public also has a pretty good idea as well. Indeed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recently ruled that a redacted version of the al-Awlaki memo can and should be disclosed, largely because much of its reasoning had already been made public in the White Paper. Thus, while I fully support the public disclosure of the memo, redacted to protect sources and methods, every Senator already has full access to the memo, and therefore can make an informed judgment on advice and consent. And the public also has a good sense of what it says. Notably, Senators Ron Wyden, Mark Udall, and Martin Heinrich, all members of the Intelligence Committee, wrote a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder in November 2013, after reviewing the memo on the killing of al-Awlaki, and stating their view the killing was ``a legitimate use of the authority granted to the President.'' They went on to urge the administration to be more forthcoming about the legal limits on the use of force against U.S. persons in other cases, beyond what the memo apparently had sanctioned, but did not question the legality of the action authorized. Sen. Paul's op-ed notes that the Office of Legal Counsel may have written more than one memo on targeted killing, which is quite possible. But the administration has disclosed to the Senators the full, unredacted versions of any memo authorizing the killing of Americans, the issue Sen. Paul raises in his op-ed. Finally, holding up Barron's nomination is unlikely to expedite disclosure of the memos. It will only undermine the confirmation of someone who would make an excellent judge. The Administration has been ordered (unanimously) to release the memo, and will in short order either comply with that order or seek further review. Barron has no control over that decision, and should not be held hostage to it. I am second to none in my support for transparency. And I will continue to fight for that value on its own terms. But it is a huge mistake to let our legitimate concerns about transparency get in the way of the confirmation of a judge who will faithfully protect our liberties and hold government accountable--especially when the Senate already has been given access to all the information they need to exercise their ``advise and consent'' role. As a civil libertarian and drone critic, I have no hesitation in saying that David Barron should be confirmed.",,0,113,,0,5/14/14,,,{u'DISCLOSURE': u'PRO'},1,,

The administration has taken tentative steps toward greater transparency, formally acknowledging for the first time the United States' use of armed drones. Less visible is the extent to which Obama has institutionalized the highly classified practice of targeted killing, transforming ad-hoc elements into a counterterrorism infrastructure capable of sustaining a seemingly permanent war. Spokesmen for the White House, the National Counterterrorism Center, the CIA and other agencies declined to comment on the matrix. Privately, officials acknowledge that the development of the matrix is part of a series of moves, in Washington and overseas, to embed counterterrorism tools into U.S. policy for the long haul. White House counterterrorism adviser John O. Brennan is seeking to codify the administration's approach to generating capture/kill lists, part of a broader effort . . . CIA Director David Petraeus is pushing for an expansion of the agency's fleet of armed drones. The proposal, which would need White House approval, reflects the agency's transformation into a paramilitary force and makes clear that it does not intend to dismantle its drone program and return to pre-September 11 focus on gathering intelligence. The U.S. Joint Special Operations Command, which carried out the raid that killed bin Laden, has moved command teams into suspected terrorist hotbeds in Africa. A rugged U.S. outpost in Djibouti has been transformed into a launchpad for counterterrorism operations across the Horn of Africa and into the Middle East. The Joint Special Operations Command has also established a secret targeting center across the Potomac River from Washington. The current and former U.S. official said the elite command's targeting cells have traditionally been located along the front lines of its missions, including Iraq and Afghanistan. But the joint committee has now created a national capital region task force that is a 15-minute commute from the White House so it can be more directly involved in deliberations about the al-Qaida list. The developments were described by current and former officials from the White House as well as intelligence and counterterrorism agencies. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.

  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012--Continued",-1,CALIFOR,"Dear Mr. Chairman: The legislation you have proposed to update and clarify the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (``AUMF''), passed in September 2001 in the wake of the attacks on the United States that occurred that month, is both timely and constructive. Since its passage, the AUMF has not been updated to reflect the evolving nature and origin of the Islamist threat against this country. Indeed, there are organizations, including the Pakistani Taliban, that are arguably not within its reach, and although we have fought and detained thousands of enemy fighters captured not only in Afghanistan and Iraq, but also in Somalia, Yemen and Pakistan, and continue to detain hundreds, the AUMF does not even refer to detention, let alone prescribe standards for detention. As a result of this inaction, we have simply allowed policy makers and judges to improvise how we deal with the evolving terrorist threat and how we treat those we encounter on the battlefield. The increased use of remotely piloted aircraft--drones--has allowed us to strike lethally, but because dead men tell no tales and records destroyed in drone attacks cannot be exploited, we may unconsciously be defaulting toward strategies that do not allow us to act as effectively as we might if we captured terrorists instead of killing them. Your new legislation would not confer new powers, but rather would add order and rationality to what has been an improvisational exercise overseen by judges who do not have the fact-finding resources of Congress, or the accountability that comes from being responsible for protecting the national security. I cannot for the life of me understand the opposition to this measure that is coming from people who profess to be concerned with civil liberties and the rule of law, and yet seem to prefer an improvisational arrangement that does not make us face up to the fact that we are detaining people. If anything, such a system creates the occasion for offloading our detention responsibility to countries that will treat detainees much less humanely than we would, or killing instead of capturing, which can hardly be said to present a humane alternative or one governed by legal principles.

First and foremost, let me say that I am in total agreement with your assessment. Simply put, no desired end state has ever been clearly articulated and no strategy formulated that would lead us to achieve even an ill defined end state. A few points: 1. The strategy of ``clear, hold and build'' would lead one to believe that the US and its Allies are capable of coordinating the elements of national power needed to affect such a strategy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Just getting DOS and DOD on the same page is difficult enough . . . getting NGO's and nation building expertise into the fight is simply a non-starter in a country as dysfunctional as Afghanistan. 2. Your point about troop strength required to ``protect'' the population and carry out effective counterinsurgency operations is spot on. Instead of a surge of 21,000 troops, McChrystal would need a surge of hundreds of thousands. Not only would our Nation not support such a surge but, MOST distressing, the Military could not support such a surge. Not only are our troops being run ragged but, equally important and totally off most people's radar screens, our equipment is being run ragged. At some point in time, the bill for that equipment will come due and it will be a very large bill. 3. Typical of the 21st Century fight, we are fighting ideas as well as warriors. You cannot defeat ideas with bullets . . . you must defeat them with better ideas. For many reasons such as the dysfunction found in the Karzai government, the tribal nature of the country, the abject poverty of the average citizen, the inextricable link to Pakistan, we have been unable to come up with better ideas. We are systematically destroying the poppy fields . . . the country's major source of revenue. At the same time, we are trying to encourage other agricultural efforts. This is one of our ``better ideas''?? Sad as it is to say, we would do better to buy the poppy crop ourselves . . . ridding the world of a source of drugs and maintaining the Afghan economy. 4. What in Afghanistan is deemed in our Nation's vital interest? Seriously? Who is the enemy? Seriously? Is the enemy of the United States the Taliban? Is the enemy al Queda? We need to determine the answer to those questions immediately. One would think we would have answered them already but none of our actions to date would indicate that we have. Finally, your recommendation is sound. I would put ``hunter-killer teams'' along the borders and in suspected al Queda strongholds. I would support them with intelligence, logistics thru the use of parasail's, responsive airpower (need to be close), armed and unarmed (fitted with cameras, infrared, etc) drones, ``reach back'' capability for cruise missiles, and other capability as needed. The H-K Teams should be given minimal rules of engagement . . . when they identify the bad guys, they need to be empowered to take them out. Again, don't be dismayed by the people who disagree with you. There are many retired and active duty military who feel you hit the bull's eye.

  Continued",,MASSACH,"It is clear that in the 4 years since the UNSCOM inspectors were forced out, Saddam Hussein has continued his quest for weapons of mass destruction. According to intelligence, Iraq has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of the 150 kilometer restriction imposed by the United Nations in the ceasefire resolution. Although Iraq's chemical weapons capability was reduced during the UNSCOM inspections, Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort over the last 4 years. Evidence suggests that it has begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including mustard gas, sarin, cyclosarin, and VX. Intelligence reports show that Iraq has invested more heavily in its biological weapons programs over the 4 years, with the result that all key aspects of this program--R, production and weaponization--are active. Most elements of the program are larger and more advanced than they were before the gulf war. Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating agents and is capable of quickly producing and weaponizing a variety of such agents, including anthrax, for delivery on a range of vehicles such as bombs, missiles, aerial sprayers, and covert operatives which could bring them to the United States homeland. Since inspectors left, the Iraqi regime has energized its missile program, probably now consisting of a few dozen Scud-type missiles with ranges of 650 to 900 kilometers that could hit Israel, Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the region. In addition, Iraq is developing unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs, capable of delivering chemical and biological warfare agents, which could threaten Iraq's neighbors as well as American forces in the Persian Gulf.",1,0,107,86,0,10/9/02,3,0,{u'FOREIGNUSE': u'ANTI'},1,443,

The article identifies White House Counterterrorism Chief John Brennan as the official assuming the role of Obama's de facto assassination czar, raising concerns even within the Obama administration that the White House is increasingly turning into ``a pseudo-military headquarters'' under the direction of just a few senior Obama administration officials. Adding to these concerns are serious questions about Brennan's qualification for this role. Even before the 2008 election, eyebrows were raised over Brennan's role in the Obama campaign. An employee of The Analysis Corporation, of which Brennan was CEO, had improperly accessed passport information for Hillary Clinton, Obama's Democratic primary challenger at the time, and GOP nominee John McCain. At the time, Brennan was a top adviser to the Obama campaign, and Brennan's employee was not fired. One of the key witnesses in the case was found murdered in his car outside his church while the investigation was still ongoing. Brennan was involved in administration intrigue related to the release of convicted Libyan Pan Am Flight 103 bomber from a Scottish jail in August 2009. At the time of Megrahi's release, when he returned to Libya to a national hero's welcome, Brennan described the release as ``unfortunate, inappropriate, and wrong'' and called for his reimprisonment. However, Obama administration documents obtained by The Sunday Times revealed that the White House had secretly informed Scottish authorities that they found compassionate release more palatable than the reimprisonment of Megrahi in Libya. Brennan also came under fire after would-be underwear bomber Umar Farouk--and I won't try that last name--nearly brought down a U.S.-bound Northwest Airlines flight on Christmas Day 2009. British intelligence authorities had notified their U.S. counterparts of an ``Umar Farouk'' meeting with al Qaeda cleric Anwar al Awlaki in Yemen, and Umar Farouk's father had warned of his son's increasing extremism to CIA officials at the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria. However, Umar Farouk was never added to the U.S. no-fly list, nor was his U.S. visa revoked.",0,0,113,696,0,2/6/13,49,2,{u'': u''},1,937,

As Members of this Administration have previously indicated, the U.S. government has not carried out drone strikes in the United States and has no intention of doing so. As a policy matter, moreover, we reject the use of military force where well-established law enforcement authorities in this country provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat. We have a long history of using the criminal justice system to incapacitate individuals located in our country who pose a threat to the United States and its interests abroad. Hundreds of individuals have been arrested and convicted of terrorism-related offenses in our Federal courts. The question you have posed is therefore entirely hypothetical, unlikely to occur, and one we hope no President will ever have to confront. It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States. For example, the President could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the military to use such force if necessary to protect the homeland in the circumstances of a catastrophic attack like the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11,",0,0,113,1399,0,3/6/13,67,1,{u'': u''},0,533,-1

This prestigious award was given at the 2013 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. The Intel International Science and Engineering Fair is the world's largest international science competition for high school students, and this year it provided a forum for approximately 1,500 students from 70 countries, regions, and territories to showcase their independent research. Since 2008, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has selected three projects to receive awards for exemplary work in addiction science, and I am extremely proud that a winning project came from the hard work and dedication of one of my constituents. Ms. Sonksen's project, ``Determining the Behavioral and Physiological Effects of Pentedrone-Based Bath Salts on Drosophila Melangaster,'' studied the effects of two versions of the drugs called ``bath salts'' on the common fruit fly. She looked at three possible effects: mortality, feeding patterns, and activity levels. Many of the flies died from exposure to bath salts, and many others decreased their feeding activity. Her research showed that the substances, while commonly considered stimulants, acted more like hallucinogens, with the flies appearing to be in a daze. I am proud that Ms. Sonksen not only took the time and energy to submit an award winning project but also focused her efforts on such an important issue. Bath salts are emerging synthetic stimulants that often contain amphetamine-like chemicals. Addiction and abuse of these drugs has dramatically increased over the past few years and has resulted in a number of hospitalizations and even deaths. I appreciate the awareness Ms. Sonksen has raised to the issues surrounding bath salts through her research and submission of her project. In closing, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring Aliana Sonksen's Addiction Science Award and her hopeful future of contributing to addiction science for many years to come.",0,0,113,576,0,6/6/13,34,0,{u'': u''},1,1017,

Revelations that top officials are targeting people to be assassinated abroad, including American citizens, are only the most recent, disturbing proof of how far our nation's violation of human rights has extended. This development began after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and has been sanctioned and escalated by bipartisan executive and legislative actions, without dissent from the general public. As a result, our country can no longer speak with moral authority on these critical issues. While the country has made mistakes in the past, the widespread abuse of human rights over the last decade has been a dramatic change from the past. With leadership from the United States, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in 1948 as ``the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.'' This was a bold and clear commitment that power would no longer serve as a cover to oppress or injure people, and it established equal rights of all people to life, liberty, security of person, equal protection of the law and freedom from torture, arbitrary detention or forced exile. The declaration has been invoked by human rights activists and the international community to replace most of the world's dictatorships with democracies and to promote the rule of law in domestic and global affairs. It is disturbing that, instead of strengthening these principles, our government's counterterrorism policies are now clearly violating at least 10 of the declaration's 30 articles, including the prohibition against ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.'' Recent legislation has made legal the president's right to detain a person indefinitely on suspicion of affiliation with terrorist organizations or ``associated forces,'' a broad, vague power that can be abused without meaningful oversight from the courts or Congress (the law is currently being blocked by a federal judge). This law violates the right to freedom of expression and to be presumed innocent until proved guilty, two other rights enshrined in the declaration. In addition to American citizens' being targeted for assassination or indefinite detention, recent laws have canceled the restraints in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to allow unprecedented violations of our rights to privacy through warrantless wiretapping and government mining of our electronic communications. Popular state laws permit detaining individuals because of their appearance, where they worship or with whom they associate. Despite an arbitrary rule that any man killed by drones is declared an enemy terrorist, the death of nearby innocent women and children is accepted as inevitable. After more than 30 airstrikes on civilian homes this year in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai has demanded that such attacks end, but the practice continues in areas of Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen that are not in any war zone. We don't know how many hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed in these attacks, each one approved by the highest authorities in Washington. This would have been unthinkable in previous times. These policies clearly affect American foreign policy. Top intelligence and military officials, as well as rights defenders in targeted areas, affirm that the great escalation in drone attacks has turned aggrieved families toward terrorist organizations, aroused civilian populations against us and permitted repressive governments to cite such actions to justify their own despotic behavior. Meanwhile, the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, now houses 169 prisoners. About half have been cleared for release, yet have little prospect of ever obtaining their freedom. American authorities have revealed that, in order to obtain confessions, some of the few being tried (only in military courts) have been tortured by waterboarding more than 100 times or intimidated with semiautomatic weapons, power drills or threats to sexually assault their mothers. Astoundingly, these facts cannot be used as a defense by the accused, because the government claims they occurred under the cover of ``national security.'' Most of the other prisoners have no prospect of ever being charged or tried either. At a time when popular revolutions are sweeping the globe, the United States should be strengthening, not weakening, basic rules of law and principles of justice enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But instead of making the world safer, America's violation of international human rights abets our enemies and alienates our friends. As concerned citizens, we must persuade Washington to reverse course and regain moral leadership according to international human rights norms that we had officially adopted as our own and cherished throughout the years.

1,0,,,15,,,8ec4767191ca204edc15fcdc5c314c1e,,,,,PRESIDENTIAL STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIL,0,,"Kabul, Afghanistan.--Supporters of the Islamic State group in Afghanistan are attempting to establish a regional base in the eastern city of Jalalabad, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John Campbell, said on Tuesday. In an interview with The Associated Press, Campbell said that ``foreign fighters'' from Syria and Iraq had joined Afghans who had declared loyalty to the group in the eastern province of Nangarhar, bordering Pakistan. He said there were also ``indications'' that the IS supporters in Nangarhar were trying to consolidate links with the group's leadership in Syria and Iraq. The Islamic State group controls about a third of Iraq and Syria. Fighters loyal to the group in Afghanistan include disaffected Afghan and Pakistani Taliban who have fought fierce battles with the Taliban in recent months. Afghan officials have said that IS supporters control a number of border districts in Nangarhar and have a presence in some other southern provinces, including Zabul and Ghazni. Until now, however, it was unclear whether loyalists in Afghanistan had institutional links to the group's leadership. Many of those who had declared allegiance to IS were ``disenfranchised Taliban'' from both sides of the border, Campbell said. But, he added, ``they've been reaching out. I'm sure there are folks who have come from Syria and Iraq--I couldn't tell you how many but there are indications of some foreign fighters coming in there. ``But they don't have the capability right now to attack Europe, or attack the homeland, the United States. But that's what they want to do, they've said that's what they want to do,'' he said. During the summer months, Taliban and IS loyalists fought fierce battles in the far eastern districts of Nangarhar, with residents reporting a range of atrocities, including arbitrary imprisonment, forced marriages for young women, and beheadings. The IS loyalists have said they want to absorb Afghanistan into a larger province of its ``caliphate'' called Khorasan. Campbell said the group wants to establish a base in Nangarhar's provincial capital, Jalalabad ``as the base of the Khorasan province'' and ``work their way up into Kunar'' province immediately north. The first credible reports of an IS presence in Afghanistan emerged earlier this year in northern Helmand, though recruiters believed to have had links to the leadership in Syria were killed by U.S. drone strikes in February. The presence in Nangarhar became clear in the summer, when IS loyalists launched battles against the Taliban in the border regions. For months, the Afghan forces--occupied with fighting elsewhere--had let the two groups fight each other, Campbell said. ``If the Taliban and ISIL want to kill each other, let them do it,'' he said, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State group. He said that control of the four districts--Achin, Nazyan, Bati Kot and Spin Gar--had seesawed between the two groups. The revelation in July that the Taliban's founder and leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar had been dead for more than two years has led to deep fissures in the leadership, and infighting between rival Taliban factions that Campbell said had left hundreds dead. Campbell, who took control of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan in mid-2014, said splits among the Taliban, who have been trying to overthrow the Afghan government since their regime was driven from power in 2001 by the U.S. invasion, could make the fight even harder in 2016. ``The prize really is Kandahar, that's their strategic goal,'' he said, referring to the southern province from where the Taliban emerged after Afghanistan's vicious civil war ended in 1996. Neighboring Helmand province, where most of the world's opium is produced, is currently the scene of fierce battles for control of strategically important districts, including Marjah. Taliban fighters took control of the northern city of Kunduz in September, for just three days before the Afghan military, backed by U.S. forces, pushed them out. Campbell said he did not believe the Taliban had planned to hold or govern Kunduz, but the psychological impact of the city's fall had been enormous. Jalalabad, he said, ``is not going to fall.'' Afghan forces, ``challenged in many areas, understand the impact of Kunduz,'' he said. ``I think they will make the right adjustments so that it (Jalalabad) doesn't become another Kunduz.''",,0,114,,0,12/17/15,,,{u'REFERENCE': u'NEUTRAL'},0,,

Many of those challenging the administration on this issue are motivated more by politics than by policy. Some doing the challenging were strongly in favor of going to war against Iraq when it appeared politically popular to do so, but are now chagrined that the war is not going as smoothly as was hoped. I am sure once the alleged attempt to buy uranium is thoroughly debunked, the other excuses for going to war will be examined with a great deal of scrutiny as well. It is obvious that the evidence used to justify going to war is now less than convincing. The charge that Saddam Hussein had aluminum tubes used in manufacturing nuclear weapons was in error. A fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles capable of dispensing chemical and biological weapons did not exist. The 63,000 liters of anthrax and botulism have not been found, nor have any of the mobile germ labs. There are no signs of the 1 million pounds of sarin, mustard and VX gasses. No evidence has been revealed to indicate Iraq was a threat to anyone's security, let alone ours. The charge that Saddam Hussein was connected to the al Qaeda was wrong. Saddam Hussein's flaunting of the UN resolutions regarding weapons of mass destruction remains unproven. How could so many errors have occurred? Some say it was ineptness while others claim outright deception and lies. There are some who say it was selective use of intelligence to promote a particular policy already decided upon. This debate, I am sure, will rage on for a long time, and since motivations are subjective and hard to prove, resolving the controversy will be difficult. However, this should not diminish the importance of sorting out the truth from the fiction, the errors from the malice. One question, though, I hope gets asked is why should we use intelligence cited by a foreign government as a justification for going to war? One would think that with the billions we spend, we could fully rely on our own intelligence-gathering agencies. Another point of interest, lacking a coherent foreign policy, we have support for war coming from different groups depending on circumstances unrelated to national defense. For instance, those who strenuously objected to Kosovo promoted war in Iraq. And those who objected to Iraq are now anxious to send troops to Liberia. For some, U.N. permission is important and necessary. For others, the U.N. is helpful as long as it endorses the war they want. Only a few correctly look to the Constitution and to the Congress to sort out the pros and cons of each conflict and decide whether or not a declaration of war is warranted. The sad fact is that we have lost our way. A threat to national security is no longer a litmus test for sending troops hither and yon, and the American people no longer require Congress to declare the wars we fight. Hopefully, some day that will be changed. The raging debate over whether or not Saddam Hussein tried to buy uranium, as important as it is, distracts from the much more important strategic issue of what is the proper foreign policy in a republic. Hopefully, we will soon seriously consider the policy of noninterventionism in the affairs of others. Avoiding entangling alliances and staying out of the internal affairs of other nations is a policy most conducive to peace and prosperity and one the Founders endorsed.

The matrix contains the names of terrorism suspects arrayed against an accounting of the resources being marshaled to track them down, including sealed indictments and clandestine operations. U.S. officials said the database is designed to go beyond existing kill lists, mapping plans for the ``disposition'' of suspects beyond the reach of American drones. Although the matrix is a work in progress, the effort to create it reflects a reality setting in among the nation's counterterrorism ranks: The United States' conventional wars are winding down, but the government expects to continue adding names to kill or capture lists for years. Among senior Obama administration officials, there is a broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade. Given the way al-Qaida continues to metastasize, some officials said no clear end is in sight. ``We can't possibly kill everyone who wants to harm us,'' a senior administration said. ``It's a necessary part of what we do . . . We're not going to wind up in 10 years in a world of everybody holding hands any saying, ``We love America.'' That timeline suggests that the United States has reached only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on terrorism. Targeting lists that were regarded as finite emergency measures after the attacks of September 11 are now fixtures of the national security apparatus.

1,0,,,1,,,e687f8beaca238ad5d1b90e159da662a,,,,,DEFENSE MODERNIZATION,,,"The International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military Balance 2010 report places China third in the number of artillery systems it fields, after Russia and North Korea. But China doubtless exceeds both in resource commitment and breadth of artillery investments. Credited with an estimated 17,700-plus towed, self-propelled and rocket systems, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has at least 56 artillery systems in use, development or available for export. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps, by contrast, have 8,187-plus artillery pieces of roughly 10 types. China has had a mixed record of using artillery for military and political-military goals. Its successes as when it routed Indian forces in 1962 with the high-altitude use of artillery and mortars, have been offset by incidents provoking third-party responses or leading to regional standoffs. Examples include the shelling of islands controlled by Taiwan in 1955-58, resulting in U.S. intervention and a stalemate over the Taiwan Strait. In July, a unit based in the Nanjing military region fired missiles from 300-mm. PHL-03 multiple rocket launchers (MRLs) into the Yellow Sea to show China's anger at U.S. naval exercises with South Korea. The exercises, a result of China-backed North Korea's sinking of the South Korean frigate Cheonon in March, went ahead anyway. China evolution as an artillery power stems from Soviet and Russian influences dating to the Korean War Soviet artillery and training improved PLA artillery operations during the war and led to the formation of the first formal artillery command. Soviet aid continued through the 1950s, and by the time of the Sin-Soviet split of the 1960s, China was producing copies or modified versions of Soviet pieces. The PLA makes extensive use of Soviet-origin 152-, 130- and 122-mm. calibers, though Western calibers such as the 155- and 105-mm. are seeing greater use. China purchased the Russian 9A52 Smerch 300-mm. MRL in the 1990s, and the PLA produced a near facsimile in the A-100/PHL-03 MRL. The 155- mm. PLZ-05 self-propelled artillery system that emerged in 2005 bears an uncanny resemblance to the Russian 2519 MSTA. In the 1990s, PLA artillery was affected by reforms in strategy (its closest concept to doctrine) and organization. Toward the end of the decade, the PLA was immersed in strategy goals of ``informatization'' and ``mechanization.'' The former included the broad application of improving information technologies, which for artillery included new computer-based fire controls and ever-improving digital communication and command linkages. PLA artillery units increasingly include flrefinding counter-battery radar such as the 50-km.-range (31-mi.) SLC-2 and Type 704, and use sophisticated electronic warfare systems such as the Russian SPR-2 radio fuse jammer, a possible Chinese facsimile and possibly a recently revealed artillery radar jammer. Artillery recon vehicles and recon troops feature advanced optronic and digital communication capabilities. In addition, PLA artillery units have sophisticated meteorological capabilities and use muzzle velocity radar to improve accuracy. Mechanization put renewed emphasis on developing tracked and wheeled self-propelled tubed artillery, with rocket artillery largely truck-mounted. This trend was emphasized in late 2004 when Chinese Communist Party and PLA leader Hu Jintao enunciated the PLAs new ``historic missions,'' a euphemism for invasions, which call on the PLA to defend state interests abroad. It is likely that new medium-weight artillery systems based on airmobile armored personnel carriers will follow for these strategic missions. Organic PLA artillery units have decreased in size, following the pattern of general large-scale troop reductions. When combined with ``informatization'' advances, this will permit many infantry and armored divisions to be reformed into mechanized brigades. However, in a counter- trend that emphasizes their continued importance, the PLA maintains five independent artillery divisions and 20 independent brigades. Of these, two divisions and six brigades are stationed in the Shenyang and Beijing military regions, for potential Korean contingencies. Three divisions and eight brigades are in the Nanjing Guangzhou and Jinan military regions, for Taiwan contingencies. Among artillery systems, mortars include a 60-mm. hand-held system used by infantry and special forces. The new Type 93 60-mm. fixed mortar weighs 22.4 kg. (49.2 lb.) and fires 20 rounds/min. to 5.5 km. There are also fixed W91 and W87 81- mm. mortars that fire to 8 km. and 5.6 km., respectively. The PLA has largely copied Russia's Vasilyek 81-mm. automatic mortar, called the W99 or SM-4, which comes in a towed version or mounted in a Hummer-like vehicle. It fires four rounds in 2 sec. out to 6.2 km. The W86 120-mm. towed mortar weighs 206 kg. and fires 20 rounds/min. to 4.7 km. In 2001, the PLA revealed the PLL-05 mobile mortar based on the Russian 120-mm. 2S23 NONA-SVK that it purchased in the 1990s, but mounted on a WZ-551 6 X 6 armored personnel carrier (APC). It fires a rocket-assisted round 13.5 km. In 2007, the PLA revealed a laser-guided 120-mm. mortar round, though it is not clear if it is in service. Towed and self-propelled tubed systems dominate artillery units. The largest number of towed guns are likely the 122- mm. versions. These include the Type-96, based on the Russian D-30, with a 360-deg. traversing base, and the simpler Type- 83. Their rocket-assisted rounds have a 27-km. range. The Type-59 130-mm. towed gun fires a rocket-assisted round 44 km. Of heavy towed artillery, the 152-mm. Type-66, a copy of the Russian D-20, is most numerous and fires rocket-assisted rounds 28 km. In 1999, the PLA revealed the 155-mm. PLL01/WA 021 towed artillery system, based on the Austrian Noricum GH N-45, which fires a rocket-assisted round 50 km. The PLL01 and the Type-66 fire 155- and 152-mm. versions of the Russian Krasnopol laser-guided shell. Self-propelled tubed artillery includes the PLL02, which places the Type-86 100-mm. gun on a WZ-551 APC. In 2009, the PLA revealed the new Type-07 122-mm. tracked artillery system, which features hull and electronic improvements over the previous Type-89 Tracked 122-mm. system. In 2009, photographs appeared on the Internet of the SH-3, a truck- mounted 122-mm. artillery system with digital control systems in a hatch over the cab. Heavy self-propelled systems include the 155-mm. PLZ-05, which has a version of the PLL01 gun, and appeared in 2005. It is replacing the 152-mm. Type-83, which entered service in 1983. The PLZ-05 also fires the Krasnopol laser-guided projectile and a rocket-assisted round 50 km., and is capable of flat-trajectory antitank fire. Unconfirmed reports state the PLZ-05 has an automatic gun-loading system and weighs 35 tons. PLA investments in rocket artillery are impressive. A five- wheel all-terrain vehicle has been modified to carry a 107- mm. MRL for experimental mechanized special forces units. The tracked Type-89 and more recent Type-90 truck-mounted 122-mm. MRL feature self-contained 40-round rocket reloaders. In addition, the Smerch-derived 12-round PHL-03, which reportedly fires a 150-km.-range missile, is entering increasing numbers of artillery units. The latest AR1A export variant features a modular U.S. MLR system-style 5-round rocket carrier, which speeds reloading. In 2009, Norinco revealed an as yet unidentified truck carrier for this 5- round rocket box, similar to Lockheed Martin's High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System. The PLA is also investing in larger MRL systems. The 400- mm. WS-2D reportedly has a range of 400 km., and one payload features three ``killer unmanned aerial vehicles,'' according to a Chinese report. An earlier 200-km.-range version, the WS-3, uses navigation satellite guidance to achieve a remarkable 50-meter (164-ft.) circular error probable. The WS family complements the 150-km.-range P-12 and 250-km. B-611M maneuverable navsat-guided short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), which could supplement or replace the PLA's two brigades of 300-600-km. DF-11A SRBMs. New artillery systems are entering amphibious and airborne units for possible missions abroad. PLA marine and army amphibious units are receiving the Type-07B tracked 122-mm. amphibious artillery system, which places the gun from the Type-07 on a larger hull. Airborne units are equipped with a version of the Type-96 122-mm. gun, but a new tracked airmobile APC may feature a mortar or gun system. The ZBD-09 122-mm. gun system could eventually feature in airmobile army units. Future artillery systems may feature electromagnetic launch, an area of extensive research. The PLA is also interested in ramjet-powered and stealth-coated artillery shells.",,0,111,,0,9/29/10,,,{u'REFERENCE': u'NEUTRAL'},1,,

His son sneaks out of the house and goes to Yemen. His son is then killed by a drone strike. They won't tell us if he was targeted. I suspect, since there were other people in the group--there were about 20 people killed--that they were targeting someone else. I don't know that.

Warren Weinstein dedicated over 40 years of his life to international development work. Throughout his career, he worked with vulnerable populations throughout Africa and South Asia. He served as Peace Corps country director in Togo and the Ivory Coast. Most recently, he spent 10 years working on economic development projects as an adviser to J.E.

Mr. Weinstein's life and approach to development work showcased the ideals of the institutions that he served: USAID, the Peace Corps, and others. He left the comforts of home and dedicated his career to improving the lives of others in countries that were not his own. He spoke seven languages and immersed himself in the local culture of the countries in which he worked.

As the storm descended on Washington, the Kentucky Republican's old- fashioned filibuster Wednesday filled the attention void on Twitter and cable TV. If only his reasoning matched the showmanship. Shortly before noon, Senator Paul began talking filibuster against John Brennan's nomination to lead the CIA. The tactic is rarely used in the Senate and was last seen in 2010. But Senator Paul said an ``alarm'' had to be sounded about the threat to Americans from their own government. He promised to speak ``until the President says, no, he will not kill you at a cafe.'' He meant by a military drone. He's apparently serious, though his argument isn't. Senator Paul had written the White House to inquire about the possibility of a drone strike against a U.S. citizen on American soil. Attorney General Eric Holder replied that the U.S. hasn't and ``has no intention'' to bomb any specific territory. Drones are limited to the remotest area of conflict zones like Pakistan and Yemen. But as a hypothetical constitutional matter, Mr. Holder acknowledged the President can authorize the use of lethal military force within U.S. territory. This shocked Senator Paul, who invoked the Constitution and Miranda rights. Under current U.S. policy, Mr. Paul mused on the floor, Jane Fonda could have been legally killed by a Hellfire missile during her tour of Communist Hanoi in 1972. A group of noncombatants sitting in public view in Houston may soon be pulverized, he declared. Calm down, Senator. Mr. Holder is right, even if he doesn't explain the law very well. The U.S. Government cannot randomly target American citizens on U.S. soil or anywhere else.",0,0,113,1398,0,3/7/13,61,2,"{u'HUMANITARIAN': u'NEUTRAL', u'DOMESTIC-LEGALITY': u'NEUTRAL'}",0,525,-1

The most extreme example came in the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act, which rejected virtually every cost-cutting measure put forward by the Pentagon, from base closings to retiring unneeded weapons systems. If the House's actions aren't reversed, they would bust the current budget caps to the tune of $50 billion over the next five years. There was one place the House authorizers were willing to cut way back: a program designed to help communities adjust to defense downsizings. This is particularly ill-advised at a time when the Pentagon budget has been set on a path to come down from a war-time buildup that brought it to its highest levels since World War II. While modest by historical terms, the defense build-down that is now underway will demand adjustments in the unrealistic spending plans Congress continues to authorize for the Pentagon. And the cuts that are coming will have impacts in scores of communities across the country. Since the 1970s a small office within the Pentagon, the Office of Economic Adjustment, has offered planning grants and technical assistance to help these communities develop their own strategies to capitalize on existing economic strengths and adjust to postwar economic conditions. Once these strategies are in place, the OEA serves as a point of contact for impacted communities in accessing resources from other federal agencies to help with implementation of their plans. Just this week Ohio, Michigan and Indiana received a grant of more than $2.4 million to fund a regional Defense Manufacturing Assistance Program to address the loss of 3,900 defense-related jobs in those three states since 2012. Most members of Congress want to base their judgments on Pentagon spending on what is needed to defend the country. But they also need to show defense-dependent communities, businesses and workers in their states and districts that they are watching out for their interests. The OEA's programs give them a way to judge procurement spending accounts on their merits, while attending to the economic needs of their constituents. Supporting the OEA does not mean that members of Congress don't care about the existing jobs base. It just means that they want in addition to have a Plan B in place in the event of decisions that reduce Pentagon-related activities in their areas. It's troubling to watch the House voting to slash the OEA, while standing firm in supporting costly, unneeded sacred cows like the F-35 combat aircraft. Even slightly slowing the pace of the F-35 program would pay for the OEA's programs many times over. The F-35--the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program ever undertaken is--a poster child of waste. Current cost estimates for building and maintaining the plane: roughly $1.4 trillion over its lifetime. It has more than doubled in price since it went into development, and it has had numerous high profile failures, from cracked wings to unresolved software problems. It is likely to perform many of its assigned tasks less effectively than current generation aircraft. An Air Force far superior to any other should be in no rush to build over 2,400 F-35s. The F-35 merely tops the House's list of unnecessary expenditures. It rejected plans to delay the refueling of an aircraft carrier at a savings of over $800 million--more than ten times the cut proposed for the OEA. It attempts to block the closure of excess military bases, stop the administration from reducing the size of the Army, and prevent the Air Force from retiring the U-2 spy plane, even as it funds Global Hawk drones to do the same job. And the list goes on. The common thread in all of these actions is a state of denial about the trends in Pentagon spending. It will come down this year, and under current law it will stabilize at levels considerably lower than what the Pentagon's overly ambitious plans will cost. Funding programs that will help communities make the transition to more diversified economies that can weather reductions in Pentagon spending will make it easier to craft budgets that put security concerns above pork barrel politics. When the House and Senate put together a final Pentagon budget proposal later this year, funding for OEA's crucial programs should be restored.",1,0,113,199,1,6/18/14,33,1,{u'': u''},1,979,

On September 30, 2015, the Simpson, which is the last active Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate, will be decommissioned and leave the active United States Navy fleet. The Simpson is named for Rear Admiral Rodger W. Simpson (1898-1964), who was a distinguished officer during World War II. RADM Simpson was awarded the Navy Cross, Silver Star and Legion of Merit for rescuing and evacuating more than 7,500 Allied prisoners of war and civilians interned in Japanese concentration camps. The USS Simpson was commissioned on November 9, 1985. From its first overseas deployment, the USS Simpson and her crew have distinguished themselves in combat. On April 18, 1988, along with two other navy ships, the Simpson responded to the Iranian mine attack on the USS Samuel B. Roberts by destroying an Iranian oil platform and sinking the Iranian Navy mission patrol combatant, Joshan. Over her 30 years of service, the Simpson made 14 deployments. Her final deployment was for seven months to the U.S. 5th and 6th Fleet areas of operation in which she conducted theater security cooperation exercises. As in the past, the crew was called on to support various task forces and performed perfectly never missing an operational commitment. Every sailor made a difference every day. In addition, some of the newest technologies in the Navy were aboard, four Fire Scouts (MQ-8B) vertical takeoff and landing tactical unmanned aerial vehicles. The crew on the last deployment was comprised of reservists as well as active duty individual augmented personnel with zero previous experience with UAV's. Despite the challenges, the officers aboard reported the crew achieved the highest ever recorded maintenance readiness and sortie completion rate of any Fire Scout deployment in the program's history. The Simpson will be decommissioned but the friendships and camaraderie this ship established on its decks will last for ages. It is a pleasure and honor to represent the great men and women who serve in the 4th Congressional District of Florida and to see them successfully complete the mission of the USS Simpson. Their hard work and dedication contributes to the important missions of our Nation's defense and reiterates our community's importance as an anchor of national security.",0,0,114,473,0,9/18/15,43,1,{u'': u''},1,1109,

1,1,,,0,,,e2902b354d44affcd8bac63d84bae9cd,,,1,,PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTMENT EFFICIENCY AND STREAMLINING ACT OF 2011,0,,"President Obama failed to offer a convincing military or strategic rationale for the troop withdrawals from Afghanistan that he announced Wednesday night. In several ways, they are at odds with the strategy adopted by NATO, which aims to turn over the war to the Afghan army by the end of 2014. For that plan to succeed, military commanders believe that U.S. and allied forces must hold the areas in southern Afghanistan that have been cleared of the Taliban through this summer's fighting season as well as that of 2012. They also must sweep eastern provinces that have not yet been reached by the counterinsurgency campaign. By withdrawing 5,000 U.S. troops this summer and another 5,000 by the end of the year, Mr. Obama will make those tasks harder. By setting September 2012 as a deadline for withdrawing all of the 33,000 reinforcements he ordered in late 2009, the President risks undermining not only the war on the ground but also the effort to draw elements of the Taliban into a political settlement; the militants may prefer to wait out a retreating enemy. It also may be harder to gain cooperation from Pakistan, whose willingness to break with the Taliban is linked to its perception of U.S. determination to remain engaged in the region. U.S. allies, which have committed 40,000 troops to the 2014 plan, may revise their own exit strategies. An accelerated withdrawal of American forces would make more sense if Mr. Obama had decided to abandon the modified counterinsurgency plan he adopted at the end of 2009, which was later expanded and endorsed by NATO. Vice President Biden, among others, has pressed for a more limited counterterrorism strategy focused on combating al-Qaeda. But Mr. Obama offered no indication in Wednesday's speech that he has altered his objectives. Instead, he argued that the reduction is possible because ``we are achieving our goals. . . . We are starting this drawdown from a position of strength.'' Mr. Obama correctly pointed out that the killing of Osama bin Laden and operations in Pakistan have weakened al-Qaeda and limited its ability to attack the United States. But a Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan, which Mr. Obama's withdrawals risk, would be deeply destabilizing for a region that includes nuclear-armed Pakistan and India. If the Afghan government or army crumbles, there would be a considerable chance that the United States would lose the bases it now uses for drone attacks against al-Qaeda. Perhaps the best justification for Mr. Obama's decision is U.S. domestic opinion. As senior administration officials have pointed out, Americans have grown weary of the war; polls show that a majority support a rapid withdrawal of U.S. forces, and that view is increasingly reflected in Congress and even among Republican presidential candidates. Many in Congress cite the cost of the war--though the few billion dollars saved through a faster withdrawal will have little impact on a deficit measured in trillions. By announcing these pullouts, Mr. Obama may ease some of the political pressure while still allowing his commanders enough forces to complete the 2014 transition plan. The president's supporters point out that at the end of 2012, there will still be twice as many U.S. troops in Afghanistan--68,000--as when Mr. Obama took office. We hope those prove sufficient. But Mr. Obama's withdrawal decision, with no clear basis in strategy, increases the risk of failure.",,0,112,,0,6/23/11,,,{u'REFERENCE': u'NEUTRAL'},1,,-1

  H. CON. RES. 51, LIBYA WAR POWERS RESOLUTION",1,NORTH C,"On March 21, I reported to the Congress that the United States, pursuant to a request from the Arab League and authorization by the United Nations Security Council, had acted 2 days earlier to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe by deploying U.S. forces to protect the people of Libya from the Qaddafi regime. As you know, over these last 2 months, the U.S. role in this operation to enforce U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 has become more limited, yet remains important. Thus, pursuant to our ongoing consultations, I wish to express my support for the bipartisan resolution drafted by Senators Kerry, McCain, Levin, Feinstein, Graham, and Lieberman, which would confirm that the Congress supports the U.S. mission in Libya and that both branches are united in their commitment to supporting the aspirations of the Libyan people for political reform and self-government. The initial phase of U.S. military involvement in Libya was conducted under the command of the United States Africa Command. By April 4, however, the United States had transferred responsibility for the military operations in Libya to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the U.S. involvement has assumed a supporting role in the coalition's efforts. Since April 4, U.S. participation has consisted of: (1) non-kinetic support to the NATO-led operation, including intelligence, logistical support, and search and rescue assistance; (2) aircraft that have assisted in the suppression and destruction of air defenses in support of the no-fly zone; and (3) since April 23, precision strikes by unmanned aerial vehicles against a limited set of clearly defined targets in support of the NATO-led coalition's efforts. While we are no longer in the lead, U.S. support for the NATO-based coalition remains crucial to assuring the success of international efforts to protect civilians from the actions of the Qaddafi regime. I am grateful for the support you and other Members in Congress have demonstrated for this mission and for our brave service members, as well as your strong condemnation of the Qaddafi regime. Congressional action in support of the mission would underline the U.S. commitment to this remarkable international effort. Such a Resolution is also important in the context of our constitutional framework, as it would demonstrate a unity of purpose among the political branches on this important national security matter. It has always been my view that it is better to take military action, even in limited actions such as this, with Congressional engagement, consultation, and support.",0,0,112,580,0,6/3/11,47,1,{u'FOREIGNPOLICY': u'PRO'},1,1431,

The elder, Tamerlan--apparently named for the 14th-century Muslim conqueror famous for building pyramids of his victims' skulls to commemorate his triumphs over infidels--is dead. The younger, Dzhokhar, will stand trial when his wounds heal, in a proceeding where the most likely uncertainty will be the penalty. No doubt there will be some legal swordplay over his interrogation by the FBI's High-Value Interrogation Group without receiving Miranda warnings. But the only downside for the government in that duel is that his statements may not be used against him at trial. This is not much of a risk when you consider the other available evidence, including photo images of him at the scene of the bombings and his own reported confession to the victim whose car he helped hijack during last week's terror in Boston. But if your concern is over the larger threat that inheres in who the Tsarnaev brothers were and are, what they did, and what they represent, then worry--a lot. For starters, you can worry about how the High-Value Interrogation Group, or HIG, will do its work. That unit was finally put in place by the FBI after so-called ``underwear bomber'' named Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to blow up the airplane in which he was traveling as it flew over Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009 and was advised of his Miranda rights. The CIA interrogation program that might have handled the interview had by then been dismantled by President Obama. At the behest of such Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated groups as the Council on American Islamic Relations and the Islamic Society of North America and other self-proclaimed spokesmen for American Muslims, the FBI has bowdlerized its training materials to exclude references to militant Islamism. Does this delicacy infect the FBI's interrogation group as well? Will we see another performance like the Army's after- action report following Major Nidal Hasan's rampage at Fort Hood in November 2009, preceded by his shout ``allahu akhbar''--a report that spoke nothing of militant Islam but referred to the incident as ``workplace violence''? If tone is set at the top, recall that the Army chief of staff at the time said the most tragic result of Fort Hood would be if it interfered with the Army's diversity program. Presumably, the investigation into the Boston terror attack will include inquiry into not only the immediate circumstances of the crimes but also who funded Tamerlan Tsarnaev's months-long sojourn abroad in 2012 and his comfortable lifestyle. Did he have a support network? What training did he, and perhaps his younger brother, receive in the use of weapons? Where did the elder of the two learn to make the suicide vest he reportedly wore? The investigation should include, as well, a deep dive into Tamerlan's radicalization, the Islamist references in the brothers' social media communications, and the jihadist Web sites they visited. Will the investigation probe as well the FBI's own questioning of Tamerlan 2 years ago at the behest of an unspecified foreign government, presumably Russia, over his involvement with jihadist Web sites and other activities? Tamerlan Tsarnaev is the fifth person since 9/11 who has participated in terror attacks after questioning by the FBI. He was preceded by Nidal Hasan; drone casualty Anwar al- Awlaki; Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad--born Carlos Leon Bledsoe--who murdered an Army recruit in Little Rock in June 2009; and David Coleman Headley, who provided intelligence to the perpetrators of the Mumbai massacre in 2008. That doesn't count Abdulmutallab, who was the subject of warnings to the CIA that he was a potential terrorist.",0,0,113,620,0,4/23/13,49,2,{u'REFERENCE': u'NEUTRAL'},1,937,

PAUL KLEBNIKOV,,INDIANA,"American journalist Paul Klebnikov was shot to death outside my office building on Friday. At least it used to be my office. I worked with Klebnikov, Forbes magazine's maverick correspondent, several times in the past 10 years, sometimes in Moscow, sometimes in New York. Our paths crossed often through one of Russia's wildest decades. Eight years after we first met as he covered Boris Yeltsin's 1996 presidential election, his murder brings clarity: Nothing has changed. Brutal criminals still run amok in Russia, operating with impunity and no fear of prosecution. Klebnikov had high hopes for Russia and was determined to urge democracy along. He grew up in the United States, cradled in the close-knit Russian American community; his Russian skills were perfect and his devotion to the culture ran deep. He blossomed in journalism just as the communist bloc crumbled, and his unique understanding of ``the story'' in the region propelled his career. As we toured the Russian countryside eight years ago, he talked to peasants waiting in line to vote and grilled me with questions, too. Had I run across billionaire Boris Berezovsky in my work with the Yeltsin administration? I hadn't. Klebnikov had recently been scratching the surface of Berezovsky's brazen get-rich-quick schemes. He was convinced there was much more to the oligarch. He was in town to investigate him as well as to cover the elections. Berezovsky was one of several super-wealthy men who had back doors to Yeltsin's Kremlin. His popularity waxed and waned, but as he amassed wealth he gained unparalleled power. Experienced expatriates in Russia shared an essential rule: Don't cross these brutal billionaires, ever, or you're likely to go home in a box. Klebnikov knew this well. In Russia the mafia kills every day. He knew Paul Tatum, the Oklahoma entrepreneur who ran afoul of Moscow's mafia and was shot dead just a few hundred yards from a hotel he had founded and had fought against Mayor Yuri Luzhkov to control. After Tatum's murder, Hizzoner promised swift justice. We're still waiting. Tatum had led a loud life in Moscow. Klebnikov told me he knew Tatum's battle with city ``authorities'' was never a sound strategy for survival. The Tatum murder shook him, but he was determined to go forward with what grew into a series of articles exposing Russian corruption. After all, he was a reporter, not a businessman. As a journalist, Klebnikov was the real deal. He was based in New York through the 1990s but had more contacts in Moscow than most reporters on the ground full time. During his frequent trips to the region he accomplished more meetings before lunch than many of us could pull off in a week. Klebnikov listened as intently to the griping of a pensioner as he did to the drone of politicians. He was quick to the point, wasted no time, and drove to the center of his story like a tank. Some thought he was bold, others thought him brash, but everyone was reading. ``Godfather of the Kremlin,'' his December 1996 Forbes cover story on Berezovsky, threw new light on the doings of Russia's oligarchs. The story grew into Klebnikov's first book, with the same title, published in 2001. The exiled industrialist took the magazine to court in London, and eventually Forbes recanted accusations of violence. Those of us who lived in Moscow during Berezovsky's heyday still believe. His follow-up stories on Russian industrialists were always fair and thorough, but he didn't make many friends in the country. Soon after Vladimir Putin stepped into the presidency, Klebnikov and I met in New York. I told him he needed to watch his back with so much change afoot. He shrugged and said he was uniquely positioned to get to the heart of corruption in Russia. ``Who else is going to do it?'' he asked. I had no answer. When Forbes announced Klebnikov would lead its new Russian publication and relocate to Moscow, I immediately feared for his safety. A few months later he was dead. I think about him, sprawled bleeding on the sidewalk, coughing his final words to a reporter colleague who found him dying. Russia hasn't changed in the past decade and at this trajectory it won't be truly civilized for generations. Those who killed Klebnikov are killing today, plan to kill tomorrow, and know they'll roam free to kill for years to come. Hellbent on getting rich, they have no boundaries. Raised in a communist world devoid of morals, they have no soul. There is no valid reason why a nation so tolerant--even complicit--in organized crime should stand on par with world leaders in groups such as the World Trade Organization. Putin must stand as the guarantor of media freedom. And the Bush administration must demand results in this murder investigation and require the assassins and their bosses be detected, arrested, tried and punished to the fullest extent of the law. Or will it let Paul Klebnikov, like Paul Tatum, be just another footnote in Russia's disingenuous flirtation with world-class rule of law? We're waiting.",0,0,108,165,1,7/22/04,22,1,{u'': u''},0,793,

Karl W. Eikenberry's memos, sent as President Obama enters the final stages of his deliberations over a new Afghanistan strategy, illustrated both the difficulty of the decision and the deepening divisions within the administration's national security team. After a top-level meeting on the issue Wednesday afternoon--Obama's eighth since early last month-- the White House issued a statement that appeared to reflect Eikenberry's concerns. ``The President believes that we need to make clear to the Afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended,'' the statement said. ``After years of substantial investments by the American people, governance in Afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time.'' On the eve of his nine-day trip to Asia, Obama was given a series of options laid out by military planners with differing numbers of new U.S. deployments, ranging from 10,000 to 40,000 troops. None of the scenarios calls for scaling back the U.S. presence in Afghanistan or delaying the dispatch of additional troops. But Eikenberry's last-minute interventions have highlighted the nagging undercurrent of the policy discussion: the U.S. dependence on a partnership with a Karzai government whose incompetence and corruption is a universal concern within the administration. After months of political upheaval, in the wake of widespread fraud during the August presidential election, Karzai was installed last week for a second five- year term. In addition to placing the Karzai problem prominently on the table, the cables from Eikenberry, a retired three-star general who in 2006-2007 commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan, have rankled his former colleagues in the Pentagon--as well as Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, defense officials said. McChrystal, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, has stated that without the deployment of an additional tens of thousands of troops within the next year, the mission there ``will likely result in failure.'' Eikenberry retired from the military in April as a senior general in NATO and was sworn in as ambassador the next day. His position as a former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan is likely to give added weight to his concerns about sending more troops and fan growing doubts about U.S. prospects in Afghanistan among an increasingly pessimistic public and polarized Congress. Although Eikenberry's extensive military experience and previous command in Afghanistan were the key reasons Obama chose him for the top diplomatic job there, the former general had been reluctant as ambassador to weigh in on military issues. Some officials who favor an increase in troops said they were surprised by the last-minute nature of his strongly worded cables. In these and other communications with Washington, Eikenberry has expressed deep reservations about Karzai's erratic behavior and corruption within his government, said U.S. officials familiar with the cables. Since Karzai was officially declared reelected last week, U.S. diplomats have seen little sign that the Afghan president plans to address the problems they have raised repeatedly with him. U.S. officials were particularly irritated by a interview this week in which a defiant Karzai said that the West has little interest in Afghanistan and that its troops are there only for self-serving reasons. ``The West is not here primarily for the sake of Afghanistan,'' Karzai told PBS's ``The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' program. ``It is here to fight terrorism. The United States and its allies came to Afghanistan after September 11. Afghanistan was troubled like hell before that, too. Nobody bothered about us.'' Karzai expressed indifference when asked about the withdrawal of most of the hundreds of U.N. employees from Afghanistan after a bombing late last month in Kabul. The blast killed five foreign U.N. officials. ``They may or may not return,'' he said. ``I don't think Afghanistan will notice it.'' Eikenberry also has expressed frustration with the relative paucity of funds set aside for spending on development and reconstruction this year in Afghanistan, a country wrecked by three decades of war. Earlier this summer, he asked for $2.5 billion in nonmilitary spending for 2010, a 60 percent increase over what Obama had requested from Congress, but the request has languished even as the administration has debated spending billions of dollars on new troops. The ambassador also has worried that sending tens of thousands of additional American troops would increase the Afghan government's dependence on U.S. support at a time when its own security forces should be taking on more responsibility for fighting. Before serving as the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, Eikenberry was in charge of the Afghan army training program. Each of the four options that were presented to Obama on Wednesday were accompanied by troop figures and the estimated annual costs of the additional deployments, roughly calculated as $1 billion per thousand troops. All would draw the United States deeper into the war at a time of economic hardship and rising fiscal concerns at home. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates have backed a major increase in U.S. forces to drive the Taliban from populated areas and provide Afghan security forces and the government the space to snuff out corruption and undertake development projects. They have argued that only a large-scale counterinsurgency effort can produce a strong Afghan government capable of preventing the country from once again become an al-Qaeda haven. Those views have been balanced in internal deliberations by the hard skepticism of other Obama advisers, led by Vice President Biden. They have argued for a more narrow counterterrorism strategy that would not significantly expand the U.S. combat presence. The most ambitious option Obama received Wednesday calls for 40,000 additional U.S. troops, as outlined by McChrystal in his stark assessment of the war filed in late August. Military planners put the additional annual cost of McChrystal's recommendation at $33 billion, although White House officials say the number is probably closer to $50 billion. The extra troops would allow U.S. forces to attempt to take back and hold several Taliban havens in the southern and eastern regions of Afghanistan. One compromise option put forward by the Pentagon, with the backing of Gates, would deploy an additional 30,000 to 35,000 U.S. troops--fewer than McChrystal's optimal number to carry out his strategy--and rely on NATO allies to make up the 5,000- to 10,000-troop difference. The third option, known by military planners as ``the hybrid,'' would send 20,000 additional U.S. troops to shore up security in 10 to 12 major population areas. In the rest of the country, the military would adopt a counterterrorism strategy targeting forces allied with the Taliban and al-Qaeda, primarily in the north and east, with fighter jets, Predator drones and Special Operations troops that leave a light U.S. footprint on the ground. The military puts the annual cost of that option at $22 billion. The most modest option calls for deploying an additional 10,000 to 15,000 troops. While under consideration at the White House, the proposal holds little merit for military planners because, after building bases to accommodate 10,000 or so additional soldiers and Marines, the marginal cost of adding troops beyond that figure would rise only slightly.",1,0,111,411,1,11/18/09,3,0,{u'FOREIGNPOLICY': u'PRO'},1,965,

In a vote just before Mr. Paul, the junior senator from Kentucky, tried to blockade the nomination of John Brennan as director of central intelligence over drone policy, the Senate failed to end debate on the nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan of New York to a seat on the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia. The filibuster of Ms. Halligan didn't blow up on Twitter the way Mr. Paul's impressive 12-hour stand did. But of the two, it was the one that could renew a feud over rules governing filibusters and how the Senate handles high-level judicial nominations--an issue that has torn the chamber for years. Democrats are already in discussions on how to respond to the Halligan filibuster. They believe Republicans are dead set against confirming qualified Obama administration nominees to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They accuse Republicans of exaggerating their objections to Ms. Halligan to justify a filibuster under a 2005 agreement that short-circuited the last partisan showdown over filling judicial vacancies. That deal, crafted by the famous Gang of 14, put its signatories on record as saying they would not block confirmation votes on appeals court judges without ``extraordinary circumstances'' as determined by each individual. While only members of the gang signed it, it became informal Senate policy and defused a crisis that had Republicans threatening to execute the ``nuclear option'' and bar filibusters against judicial nominees by a simple majority vote instead of with the 67 votes historically needed to change Senate rules. It also led to President George W. Bush winning three appointments to the appeals court often considered a feeder to the Supreme Court, giving conservatives an advantage on the influential panel, which hears many federal-powers cases. In its current makeup, the court consists of four judges appointed by Republican presidents and three appointed by President Bill Clinton, with four vacancies--the most ever on that court. In filibustering Ms. Halligan, several Republicans cited extraordinary circumstances arising from her earlier work as the solicitor general for the State of New York, particularly on a case against gun manufacturers. ``Ms. Halligan advanced the novel legal theory that gun manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers contributed to a `public nuisance' of illegal handguns in the state,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, accusing her of judicial activism. ``Therefore, she argued, gun manufacturers should be liable for the criminal conduct of third parties.'' Democrats cried foul. The real reason she was blocked, they say, is that Republicans do not want to see the balance of power on the D.C. appeals court shifted. They say that Ms. Halligan was acting in her official capacity representing the State of New York, not as a jurist, and that Republicans have abandoned the extraordinary circumstances test engineered by the Gang of 14. ``If you go back to that history of what occurred back then, there is a real question of whether they have broken the deal now,'' said Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico. ``This is a key circuit for the country. What they are doing is not allowing these consensus candidate judges to get votes.'' Mr. Udall has been among a group of relatively newer members of the Senate clamoring for significant changes in the rules governing filibusters. One demand is that senators act more like Mr. Paul, and take the floor to make their case when they are trying to block a vote. In January, working to avoid a divisive fight, Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, struck a deal making some modest changes in filibuster rules. But those changes have done little so far this session to curb filibusters, as evidenced by the vote on Ms. Halligan and the politically charged obstacles raised to confirmation votes on Mr. Brennan and Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator who found himself on the receiving end of a Republican filibuster before winning confirmation as secretary of defense. The filibuster is alive and well in the Senate and, as Mr. Paul showed, may even be enjoying resurgence as grand theater. Democrats say that despite what they see as clear provocation, they are in no hurry to change the new rules after just two months in place. They say they are more inclined to explore new ways to confront Republicans over the vacancies. Mr. Udall says one option might be for the president to make multiple nominations, in effect daring Republicans to find ways to cite extraordinary circumstances in multiple instances. ``Rather than putting just one up, we should put before the Senate all four and expose what is happening here,'' said Mr. Udall, who acknowledged that Senate Democrats would need White House cooperation. ``We need to design a strategy to counter the Republicans, and we are going to need the president,'' he said. The fight will take time to unfold. Democrats say they will wait to see how Republicans respond to future appeals court nominees.

We speak, of course, of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which on Tuesday hit an ``all- time high'' of 14,253. The good times rolled steadily on through the week, and the Dow closed Friday at 14,397. Of course, the notion that these were ``record'' highs was not, strictly speaking, true. As Jeff Cox at CNBC pointed out, ``In inflation-adjusted dollars, the Dow would need to hit 15,731 to break the record.'' Nevertheless, the exciting new ordinal number sitting on the stock market index set off a chorus of hallelujahs. After all, this was the highest mark it had hit since October 2007. (Of course, if we recall correctly, that was right around the time that all of our more recent tragic economic events began to occur.) The fluctuations of the Dow are typically pored over by the media in the same way that ancient oracles pierced through the entrails of birds, seeking for whatever path might lead to the most prosperity. And in the world of politics, partisans on both sides are quick to point to the Dow as generic confirmation that their policies are working as long as the story suits their narrative anyway. And these narratives can get wild and weird and wooly quickly. Seemingly within moments of the Dow's peak, ``Dow 36,000'' author James Glassman was on the pages of Bloomberg View, taking credit for this and crowing about how his old, failed predictions were well on the way to coming true. Of course, as Jonathan Chait points out, Glassman has to toss out the entire underlying thesis of ``Dow 36,000.'' (He and coauthor Kevin Hassett ``theorized that the stock market, circa 1999, was being so undervalued that it would have been at 36,000 in the days ahead of the massive tech-bubble burst as opposed to theorizing that ``someday, maybe the Dow would hit 36,000. Probably. You know, just watch'') in order to claim vindication now. Former Reagan domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett just called Glassman a ``nitwit'' and left it at that. All of which leads to an obvious point: although we recognize that the long-term trend of the stock market is that it has an overall upward trajectory--punctuated in snapshots by the susurrations of the greed/fear cycle--it is nevertheless catnip for a lot of wild-eyed prognosticators, and the over-reliance of using the stock market as evidence of economic recovery, or the proof of economic fundamentals, is acute. So what does it say about the Dow that it could hit this dizzying new height--impressive by any measure in any era, post-crash or otherwise--at a time when the overall global economic outlook is so dismal and the domestic recovery is barely felt by the citizens who sacrificed their capital to save the world from calamity? It says that we should be gravely concerned. It says that we have a two-tiered economy, one where profits flow and another where risks lurk. It says that a lot of people are being left behind, and if October 2007 is any guide, it says that this display of prosperity may simply be an illusion. The distribution of the stock market's largesse has been the most un-egalitarian aspect of American economics for years. A full 50 percent of all capital gains go not to the richest 1 percent of Americans, but to the richest 0.1 percent, according to The Washington Post. But the stock market's persistent upward climb since the spring of 2009 has revealed another massive disparity: the multinational corporate machinery that generates stock gains has become unmoored from the economic reality in which the majority of Americans live and die. The Dow hit its peak this week amid a host of gloomy global economic forecasts. Back in January, the World Bank ``sharply reduced its estimate of global economic growth in 2013, projecting that the downturn in Europe and the United States' fiscal problems will continue to weigh on investment and spending.'' The World Bank's take on U.S. growth was similarly dismal--its 1.9 percent forecast for the coming year was less than the most pessimistic estimates of our own Federal Reserve.",1,0,113,660,1,3/14/13,43,1,{u'': u''},1,994,
