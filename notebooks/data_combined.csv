(2) The terrorist violence targeted against the United      States became more emboldened after each attack, culminating      in the deadly attacks on the World Trade Center and the      Pentagon on September 11, 2001, which killed thousands of      innocent Americans, including innocent women and children.       (3) Since September 11, 2001, the citizens of the United      States have remained the priority target of terrorist      violence, with journalists and employees of non-governmental      organizations being held hostage, tortured, and decapitated      in the name of terror.       (4) Congress has authorized the President to use all      necessary and appropriate means to defeat terrorism ; and on      numerous occasions since September 11, 2001, and throughout      the Global War on Terror, the interrogation of detainees has      yielded valuable intelligence that has saved the lives of      American military personnel and American citizens at home and      abroad.       (5) The interrogation of detainees has also provided highly      valuable insights into the structure of terrorist      organizations, their target selection process, and the      identities of key operational and logistical personnel that      were previously unknown to the Intelligence Community.       (6) The lawful interrogation of detainees is consistent      with the United States Constitution.       (7) The abuses against detainees documented at Abu Ghraib      prison in Iraq were deplorable aberrations that were not part      of United States policy and were not in keeping with the      finest traditions of the United States military and the      honorable men and women who serve.        (8) The loss of interrogation-derived information would      have a disastrous effect on the Nation's intelligence      collection and counterterrorism efforts and would constitute      a damaging reversal in the Global War on Terror during this      critical time.       (9) The apprehension, detention, and interrogation of      terrorists are essential elements to successfully waging the      Global War on Terror.       (10) The interrogation of detainees can and should continue      by the United States within the bounds of the United States      Constitution and the laws of the United States of America.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that      the apprehension, detention, and interrogation of terrorists      are fundamental to the successful prosecution of the Global      War on Terror.",,

The Asian Pacific American community is quite diverse and includes some two-dozen distinct ethnic groups who came to this country from around the world. Their diverse cultures come together under a common umbrella and their presence in my community adds a wonderfully distinct flavor. I would be remiss to selfishly consider the impact on San Francisco and San Mateo alone, because the nation as a whole have benefited from the assimilation of the Asian Pacific American population.   We know the architecture of I. M. Pei and Maya Lin, we see the reporting of Connie Chung and Ann Curry, we listen to the music of Yo Yo Ma, we watch the movies of Lucy Liu and Pat Morita, we cheer Kristi Yamaguchi and Greg Louganis at the Olympics.   Our lives have been made easier with companies like Yahoo! Inc. and Computer Associates, founded by Jerry Yang and Charles Wang, respectively. George Artani wanted to make a better stereo system and succeeded when he founded, now the most popular electronics producer, Kenwood. Military life has also proven conducive to many in the community, and many have excelled. Major General Antonio Taguba exposed the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal, and General Eric K. Shinseki became the Chief of Staff for the Army in 1999.   The advanced strides can be measured in the heights reached by the public officials. In government we depend on the leaders like San Francisco Supervisor Fiona Ma, our distinguished colleagues in the Senate, Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta, and here in the House of Representatives, my good friends from California, Robert Matsui and Mike Honda. Sec. Mineta also represented California for 20 years before becoming the first Asian American to be appointed to a cabinet-level position when he was appointed Secretary of Commerce by President Clinton.   Our appreciation of their culture has come full circle. Today we celebrate, but in the not too distant past, racist and nativist sentiments met the newest immigrants with severe prejudice. Many who came faced strict quotas and unfair immigration laws, and suffered horrible prejudice and barbarous discrimination.   Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, we interned 114,000 persons of Japanese descent, whether or not they were citizens. In San Francisco, 7,800 Japanese Americans were rounded up, taken to the Tanforan Racetrack in San Bruno and housed in the stables. ``Relocation Camps'' were built, but as President Roosevelt's Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes described them, they were nothing more than concentration camps.   Although interned by their country, many Japanese heroes fought for the freedom that their government took from them. The 442nd Regimental Combat Team was a regiment made up of persons of Japanese descent from the continental U.S. and Hawaii. The unit became the most decorated unit for its size in U.S. history. The Honorable Daniel Inouye earned the Medal of Honor fighting for the 442nd.   The Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1934 gave the Philippines its independence, but reclassified Filipinos as aliens rather than citizens, and reduced the amount of people who could legally immigrate to 50 per year. President Roosevelt used the Tydings-McDuffie Act to conscript the Filipino army into service against Japan. After fighting so courageously for our government, in 1946 Congress denied them the benefits that all other veterans received, especially disabled veterans. Today I am trying to correct this injustice and have cosponsored H.R. 664 to give Filipino Americans residing as a legal alien, or citizens of the U.S. the same health and pension benefits that all other veterans of World War II receive.   Since 1977, the month of May has been set aside to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. This is the time that we can renew our focus on the problems that face the Asian Pacific American community, problems like affordable housing, immigration concerns, and racial profiling, and we can celebrate the accomplishments of the community.   I would like to thank my colleague Mr. Mike Honda for his leadership on the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and on H.R. 56, supporting the goals of the Japanese American, German American and Italian American communities in recognizing of a National Day of Remembrance, of which I am also a cosponsor.   Their vibrant community and array of perspectives have been firmly woven into the fabric of America. I am extremely proud to serve so many Asian Pacific Americans as their Congressman.",1,

In arguing in favor of such protections earlier this month,      President Bush said any legislation ``must grant liability      protection to companies who are facing multibillion dollar      lawsuits only because they are believed to have assisted in      the efforts to defend our Nation following the 9/11      attacks.''       The head of the intelligence panel, Sen. John D.      Rockefeller, made a similar argument after the bill was      approved last week. ``The onus is on the administration, not      the companies, to ensure that the request is on strong legal      footing,'' he said.       Jeffrey H. Smith, a CIA general counsel during the Clinton      administration who now represents private companies in the      national security area, said the risk of litigation poses      an unfair threat to government officials or others who      have good reason to believe they are acting legally. He      noted that many intelligence officers now feel obliged to      carry liability insurance.       ``It seems to me that it's manifestly unfair for the      officers that conducted that program and the telecoms to now      face prosecution or civil liability for carrying out what was      on its face a totally lawful request on the part of the      government,'' Smith said. ``It's not the same as Abu Ghraib      or a CIA officer who beats someone during an interrogation.''       But civil liberties groups and many academics argue that      Congress is allowing the government to cover up possible      wrongdoing and is inappropriately interfering in disputes the      courts should decide. The American Civil Liberties Union last      campaigned against the proposed Senate legislation, saying in      a news release Friday that ``the administration is trying to      cover its tracks.''       Sen. Russell Feingold said in a statement last week that      classified documents provided by the White House ``further      demonstrate that the program was illegal and that there is no      basis for granting retroactive immunity to those who      allegedly cooperated.'' His office declined to elaborate on      the records, which were reviewed by a Feingold staffer.       Retired Rear Adm. John Hutson, dean and president of the      Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, N.H., said he is      concerned about the precedent a new immunity provision might      set.",1,

These approaches migrated to Iraq a number of ways, any of which might have been prevented by clear statements of policy from the top.

In an Armed Services Committee hearing on May 19, 2004, Senator Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Sanchez if he had approved sleep deprivation, intimidation by guard dogs, excessive noise, and inducing fear as interrogation methods for use in Abu Ghraib prison. Lt. Gen. Sanchez replied that, ``I never approved any of those measures to be used within CJTF-7 at any time in the last year.'' His statement is seemingly contradicted by a document recently released by the Pentagon in response to litigation under the Freedom of Information Act. A September 14, 2003, memo from Lt. Gen. Sanchez authorized specific interrogation methods for use in Iraq, including the use of military working dogs to exploit Arab fear of dogs, the use of sleep management and stress positions, and inducing fear through ``yelling, loud music, and light control.''",1,

                        ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006",MASSACHUSETTS,1.4218839768026155,"Two years ago I went to Iraq as an unabashed believer in      toppling Saddam Hussein. I knew his regime well from previous      visits; WMDs or no, ridding the world of Saddam would surely      be for the best, and America's good intentions would carry      the day. What went wrong? A lot, but the biggest turning      point was the Abu Ghraib scandal.      Since April 2004 the liberation of Iraq has become a      desperate exercise in damage control. The abuse of prisoners      at Abu Ghraib alienated a broad swath of the Iraqi public. On      top of that, it didn't work. There is no evidence that all      the mistreatment and humiliation saved a single American life      or led to the capture of any major terrorist, despite claims      by the military that the prison produced ``actionable      intelligence.''       The most shocking thing about Abu Ghraib was not the      behavior of U.S. troops, but the incompetence of their      leaders. Against the conduct of the Lynndie Englands and the      Charles Graners, I'll gladly set the honesty and courage of      Specialist Joseph Darby, the young MP who reported the abuse.      A few soldiers will always do bad things. that's why you need      competent officers, who know what the men and women under      their command are capable of--and make sure it doesn't      happen.       Living and working in Iraq, it's hard not to succumb to      despair. At last count America has pumped at least $7 billion      into reconstruction projects, with little to show for it but      the hostility of ordinary Iraqis, who still have an 18      percent unemployment rate. Most of the cash goes to U.S.      contractors who spend much of it on personal security. Basic      services like electricity, water and sewers still aren't up      to prewar levels. Electricity is especially vital in a      country where summer temperatures commonly reach 125 degrees      Fahrenheit. Yet only 15 percent of Iraqis have reliable      electrical service. In the capital, where it counts most,      it's only 4 percent.       The most powerful army in human history can't even protect      a two-mile stretch of road. The Airport Highway connects both      the international airport and Baghdad's main American      military base, Camp Victory, to the city center. At night      U.S. troops secure the road for the use of dignitaries; they      close it to traffic and shoot at any unauthorized vehicles.      More troops and more helicopters could help make the whole      country safe. Instead the Pentagon has been drawing down the      number of helicopters. And America never deployed nearly      enough soldiers. They couldn't stop the orgy of looting that      followed Saddam's fall. Now their primary mission is self-     defense at any cost--which only deepens Iraqis' resentment.       The four-square-mile Green Zone, the one place in Baghdad      where foreigners are reasonably safe, could be a showcase of      American values and abilities. Instead the American enclave      is a trash-strewn wasteland of Mad Max-style fortifications.      The traffic lights don't work because no one has bothered to      fix them. The garbage rarely gets collected. Some of the      worst ambassadors in U.S. history are the GIs at the Green      Zone's checkpoints. They've repeatedly punched Iraqi      ministers, accidentally shot at visiting dignitaries and      behave (even on good days) with all the courtesy of nightclub      bouncers--to Americans and Iraqis alike. Not that U.S.      soldiers in Iraq have much to smile about. They're      overworked, much ignored on the home front and widely      despised in Iraq, with little to look forward to but the      distant end of their tours--and in most cases, another tour      soon to follow. Many are reservists who, when they get home,      often face the wreckage of careers and family.       I can't say how it will end. Iraq now has an elected      government, popular at least among Shiites and Kurds, who      give it strong approval ratings. There's even some hope that      the Sunni minority will join the constitutional process.      Iraqi security forces continue to get better trained and      equipped. But Iraqis have such along way to go, and there are      so many ways for things to get even worse. I'm not one of      those who think America should pull out immediately. There's      no real choice but to stay, probably for many years to come.      The question isn't ``When will America pull out?''; it's      ``How bad a mess can we afford to leave behind?'' All I can      say is this: last one out, please turn on the lights.",1,

The perpetrators of these crimes are now being prosecuted, and the military has undertaken comprehensive reforms to prevent future abuses. As noted by the independent Schlesinger Panel in its report on detainee operations: ``There is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by senior officials or military authorities.'' Our military has detained over 80,000 individuals and the instances of detainee abuse are extremely rare and they are prosecuted when discovered.

,109,0,,,2005-02-03,,babe1e1f30b71362a9bb5e33a3c6591c,,,EXECUTIVE SESSION,,,"Dear Judge Gonzales: I enjoyed our preliminary meeting and      look forward to your confirmation hearings. In following up      on our meeting, and to give you and your staff ample      opportunity to prepare for the hearings, I write to reiterate      several concerns that I have raised in prior discussions and      correspondence. When we met on November 17, 2004, I said that      these issues will be raised, by myself and other members of      the Senate Judiciary Committee, during the upcoming hearings.      Based on our conversation, I am encouraged by your      willingness to answer questions about your role and your      views in these matters.       Photographs and reports of prisoner abuse in Iraq and other      locations show an interrogation and detention system      operating contrary to U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions. In      addition to the abhorrent images from the Abu Ghraib prison      that were published last spring, actions that have occurred      with Administration approval include the forcible rendition      of individuals to nations where they may face torture, and      the hiding of ``ghost detainees'' from the International      Committee of the Red Cross. Reports of abuse continue to      emerge. Just this week, The New York Times reported that the      Red Cross has charged U.S. military authorities with using      physical and psychological coercion ``tantamount to torture''      on prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The Washington Post is      reporting that in December 2003 Army generals in Iraq were      warned in a confidential report that members of an elite      military and CIA task force were abusing detainees. According      to The Post, the report concluded that certain arrest and      detention practices could be deemed to be ``technically''      illegal.       In letters dated May 17 and June 15 of this year, I asked      you to describe your role in both the interpretation of the      law and the development of policies that led to what I and      many others consider to have been a disregard for the rule of      law. These letters remain unanswered.       My concerns regarding the abuse of prisoners in U.S.      custody did not begin with these letters. I have been seeking      answers from the Administration for well over a year, before      the abuses at Abu Ghraib came to light. In a very few cases      my questions were answered, but with information that later      proved to be less than accurate. For example, in a news      conference on June 22, 2004, you stated, ``In Iraq, it has      always been U.S. position that Geneva applies. From the early      days of the conflict, both the White House and the      Department of Defense have been very public and clear      about that.''       However, an October 24, 2004, article in The Washington      Post revealed yet another Justice Department memo authorizing      actions that potentially violate the Geneva Conventions. The      draft memo, dated March 19, 2004, apparently was written to      authorize the CIA to transfer detainees out of Iraq for      interrogation--a practice expressly prohibited by the Geneva      Conventions. According to the memo's cover letter, it was      drafted at your request.       In another example, a June 25, 2003, letter from Department      of Defense General Counsel William Haynes stated that the      United States was adhering to its international obligations      including those under the Convention Against Torture. We      later learned of an August 1, 2002, Department of Justice      memorandum that twisted the definition of torture in      unrecognizable ways. That memo was addressed to you. We also      learned months later of the rendition of a Canadian-Syrian      citizen to Syria, despite his fear of being tortured there,      and despite the Syrian government's well-documented history      of torture. Unnamed CIA officials told the press that this      man was in fact tortured in Syria.       The Committee and the Senate will want to know your role in      these situations and your views with regard to the      development of the legal justifications that appear to      underlie so many of these actions. You will be called upon to      explain in detail your role in developing policies related to      the interrogation and treatment of foreign prisoners. The      American public and the Senate that will be called upon to      confirm your appointment deserve to know how a potential      Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer in the      nation, will interpret and enforce the laws and how you will      develop policy.       We want to know what the current policy on torture is, but      since the Administration disavowed the August 1, 2002, memo,      no public statement of policy has replaced it. Questions      remain unanswered on a host of issues. Requests to the White      House and the Department of Justice for relevant documents--     including my requests to you in May and June of this year--     have been ignored or rejected. I      urge you and the Administration to provide the documents that      have been requested by myself and others without further      delay so that the hearings will be well informed.       Another key concern you will be called upon to discuss is      how you view the duties and responsibilities of the Attorney      General. As we discussed, I view the White House Counsel      position and that of the Attorney General as quite distinct.      You may well have viewed this President as your ``client''      while serving him at the White House, although the courts do      not recognize an attorney-client privilege in that setting.      We will want to know how differently you will act and view      your responsibilities as the Attorney General of the United      States. finally, I encourage you to commit to cooperating      with all members of the Judiciary Committee on issues of      oversight and accountability. In the 108th Congress, the      Judiciary Committee failed to fulfill its oversight      responsibilities. Accountability and improving government      performance are sound and long established purposes of      congressional oversight, and accountability has been lacking      on these and other crucial issues. With a new Congress, and a      new Attorney General, I expect a return to the diligent      oversight envisioned by our Founders to ensure that the      Executive Branch remains accountable to the American people.       Our meeting was a constructive beginning at the start of      the confirmation process, and I look forward to your hearing      early next month. In the meantime, Marcelle and I send our      best wishes to you and your family and hope that you have a      restful and rewarding holiday season.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,                                        Ranking Democratic Member.",,

            USING CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST",WASHINGTON,2.370665278683354,"Let me see if I've got this straight. Perhaps two years      ago, an ``informal'' meeting of ``veterans'' of the 1980s      Iran-Contra scandal--holding positions in the Bush      administration--was convened by Deputy National Security      Adviser Elliott Abrams. Discussed were the ``lessons      learned'' from that labyrinthine, secret and illegal arms-     for-money-for-arms deal involving the Israelis, the Iranians,      the Saudis, and the Contras of Nicaragua, among others--and      meant to evade the Boland Amendment, a congressionally passed      attempt to outlaw US administration assistance to the anti-     communist Contras.       In terms of getting around Congress, the Iran-Contra vets      concluded, the complex operation had been a success--and      would have worked far better if the Central Intelligence      Agency (CIA) and the military had been kept out of the loop      and the whole thing had been run out of the vice president's      office.       Subsequently, some of those conspirators, once again with      the financial support and help of the Saudis (and probably      the Israelis and the British), began running a similar      operation, aimed at avoiding congressional scrutiny or public      accountability of any sort, out of Vice President Dick      Cheney's office. They dipped into ``black pools of money'',      possibly stolen from the billions of Iraqi oil dollars that      have never been accounted for since the US occupation began.       Some of these funds, as well as Saudi ones, were evidently      funneled through the embattled, Sunni-dominated Lebanese      government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora to the sort of      Sunni jihadist groups (``some sympathetic to al-Qaeda'')      whose members might normally fear ending up in Guantanamo and      to a group, or groups, associated with the fundamentalist      Muslim Brotherhood.       All of this was being done as part of a ``sea change'' in      the Bush administration's Middle East policies aimed at      rallying friendly Sunni regimes against Shi'ite Iran, as well      as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Syrian government--and launching      secret operations to undermine, roll back or destroy all of      the above. Despite the fact that the administration of      President George W. Bush is officia1ly at war with Sunni      extremism in Iraq (and in the more general ``global war on      terror''), despite its support for the largely Shi'ite      government, allied to Iran, that it has brought to power in      Iraq, and despite its dislike for the Sunni-Shiite civil war      in that country, some of its top officia1s may be covertly      encouraging a far greater Sunni-Shi'ite rift in the region.       Imagine. All this and much more was revealed, often in      remarkable detail, just over a week ago in ``The      redirection'', a Seymour Hersh piece in The New Yorker. Other      revelations included news of US military border crossings      into Iran, new preparations that would allow Bush to order a      massive air attack on that land with only 24 hours' notice,      and a brief window this spring when the staggering power of      four US aircraft-carrier battle groups might be available to      Bush in the Persian Gulf.       Hersh, the man who first broke the My Lai story in the      Vietnam era, has never been off his game since. In recent      years, from the Abu Ghraib prison scandal on, he has      consistently released explosive news about the plans and acts      of the Bush administration.       Imagine, in addition, that Hersh went on Democracy Now!,      Fresh Air, Hardball with Chris Matthews and CNN's Late      Edition with Wolf Blitzer and actually elaborated on these      claims and revelations, some of which, on the face of it,      seem like potentially illegal and impeachable offenses, if      they do indeed reach up to the vice president or president.       Now imagine the response: front-page headlines; editorials      nationwide calling for answers, congressional hearings, or      even the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into      some of the claims; a raft of op-ed-page pieces by the      nation's leading columnists asking questions, demanding      answers, reminding us of the history of Iran-Contra; bold      reporters from recently freed media standing up in White      House and Defense Department press briefings to demand more      information on Hersh's various charges; calls in Congress for      hearings and investigations into why the people's      representatives were left so totally out of this loop.       Uh . . .       All I can say is: if any of this happened, I haven't been      able to discover it. As far as I can tell, no one in the      mainstream even blinked on the Iran-Contra angle or the      possibility that a vast, secret Middle Eastern operation is      being run, possibly illegally and based on stolen funds and      Saudi money, out of the US vice president's office.       You can certainly find a few pieces on, or reports about,      ``The redirection''--all focused only on the possible buildup      to a war with      Iran--and the odd wire-service mention of it; but nothing      major, nothing earth-shaking or eye-popping; not, in fact, a      single obvious editorial or op-ed piece in the mainstream; no      journalistic questions publicly asked of the administration;      no congressional cries of horror; no calls anywhere for      investigations or hearings on any of Hersh's revelations, not      even an expression of fear somewhere that we might be seeing      Iran-Contra, the sequel, in our own moment.       This, it seems to me, adds up to a remarkable non-response      to claims that, if true, should gravely concern Congress, the      media and the nation.       Let's grant that Hersh's New Yorker pieces generally arrive      unsourced and filled with anonymous officials (``a former      senior intelligence official'', ``a US government consultant      with close ties to Israel''). Nonetheless, Hersh has long      mined his sources in the intelligence community and the      military to striking effect. Undoubtedly, the lack of      sourcing makes it harder for other reporters to follow up,      though when it comes to such papers as the Washington Post      and the New York Times, you would think that they might have      Washington sources of their own to query on Hersh's claims.       And, of course, editorial pages, columnists, op-ed editors,      congressional representatives and reporters at administration      news briefings don't need to do any footwork at all to raise      these subjects. (Consider, for instance, the White House      press briefing last April 10, where a reporter did indeed ask      a question based on an earlier Hersh New Yorker piece.) As      far as I can tell, there haven't even been denunciations of      Hersh's report or suggestions anywhere that it is inaccurate      or off-base. Just the equivalent of a giant, collective shrug      of the U.S. media's rather scrawny shoulders.       Since the response to Hersh's remarkable piece has been so      tepid in places where it should count, let me take up just a      few of the many issues his report raises.",1,

,108,0,,,2004-05-06,,817f0b04698e5a85584985a582b9873f,,,EXECUTIVE SESSION,,,"The horrific abuses by American interrogators and guards at      the Abu Ghraib prison and at other facilities maintained by      the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan can be traced, in      part, to policy decisions and public statements of Secretary      of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. Beginning more than two years      ago, Mr. Rumsfeld decided to overturn decades of previous      practice by the U.S. military in its handling of detainees in      foreign countries. His Pentagon ruled that the United States      would no longer be bound by the Geneva Conventions; that Army      regulations on the interrogation of prisoners would not be      observed; and that many detainees would be held incommunicado      and without any independent mechanism of review. Abuses will      take place in any prison system. But Mr. Rumsfeld's decisions      helped create a lawless regime in which prisoners in both      Iraq and Afghanistan have been humiliated, beaten, tortured      and murdered--and in which, until recently, no one has been      held accountable.       The lawlessness began in January 2002 when Mr. Rumsfeld      publicly declared that hundreds of people detained by U.S.      and allied forces in Afghanistan ``do not have any rights''      under the Geneva Conventions. That was not the case: At a      minimum, all those arrested in the war zone were entitled      under the conventions to a formal hearing to determine      whether they were prisoners of war or unlawful combatants. No      such hearings were held, but then Mr. Rumsfeld made clear      that U.S. observance of the convention was now optional.      Prisoners, he said, would be treated ``for the most part'' in      ``a manner that is reasonably consistent'' with the      conventions--which, the secretary breezily suggested, was      outdated.       In one important respect, Mr. Rumsfeld was correct: Not      only could captured al Qaeda members be legitimately deprived      of Geneva Convention guarantees (once the required hearing      was held) but such treatment was in many cases necessary to      obtain vital intelligence and prevent terrorists from      communicating with confederates abroad. But if the United      States was to resort to that exceptional practice, Mr.      Rumsfeld should have established procedures to ensure that it      did so without violating international conventions against      torture and that only suspects who truly needed such      extraordinary handling were treated that way. Outside      controls or independent reviews could have provided such      safeguards. Instead, Mr. Rumsfeld allowed detainees to be      indiscriminately designated as beyond the law--and made      humane treatment dependent on the goodwill of U.S. personnel.       Much of what has happened at the U.S. detention center in      Guantanamo Bay is shrouded in secrecy. But according to an      official Army report, a system was established at the camp      under which military guards were expected to ``set the      conditions'' for intelligence investigations. The report by      Maj. Gen. Antonio M. Taguba says the system was later      introduced at military facilities at Bagram airbase in      Afghanistan and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, even though it      violates Army regulations forbidding guards to participate in      interrogations.       The Taguba report and others by human rights groups reveal      that the detention system Mr. Rumsfeld oversees has become so      grossly distorted that military police have abused or      tortured prisoners under the direction of civilian      contractors and intelligence officers outside the military      chain of command--not in ``exceptional'' cases, as Mr.      Rumsfeld said Tuesday, but systematically. Army guards have      held ``ghost'' prisoners detained by the CIA and even hidden      these prisoners from the International Red Cross. Meanwhile,      Mr. Rumsfeld's contempt for the Geneva Conventions has      trickled down: The Taguba report says that guards at Abu      Ghraib had not been instructed on them and that no copies      were posted in the facility.       The abuses that have done so much harm to the U.S. mission      in Iraq might have been prevented had Mr. Rumsfeld been      responsive to earlier reports of violations. Instead, he      publicly dismissed or minimized such accounts. He and his      staff ignored detailed reports by respected human rights      groups about criminal activity at U.S.-run prisons in      Afghanistan, and they refused to provide access to facilities      or respond to most questions. In December 2002, two Afghan      detainees died in events that were ruled homicides by medical      officials; only when the New York Times obtained the story      did the Pentagon confirm that an investigation was underway,      and no results have yet been announced. Not until other media      obtained the photos from Abu Ghraib did Mr. Rumsfeld fully      acknowledge what had happened, and not until Tuesday did his      department disclose that 25 prisoners have died in U.S.      custody in Iraq and Afghanistan. Accountability for those      deaths has been virtually nonexistent: One soldier was      punished with a dishonorable discharge.       On Monday Mr. Rumsfeld's spokesman said that the secretary      had not read Mr. Taguba's report, which was completed in      early March. Yesterday Mr. Rumsfeld told a television      interviewer that he still hadn't finished reading it, and he      repeated his view that the Geneva Conventions ``did not      precisely apply'' but were only ``basic rules'' for handling      prisoners. His message remains the same: that the United      States need not be bound by international law and that the      crimes Mr. Taguba reported are not, for him, a priority. That      attitude has undermined the American military's observance of      basic human rights and damaged this country's ability to      prevail in the war on terrorism.",,

In following up      on our meeting, and to give you and your staff ample      opportunity to prepare for the hearings, I write to reiterate      several concerns that I have raised in prior discussions and      correspondence. When we met on November 17, 2004, I said that      these issues will be raised, by myself and other members of      the Senate Judiciary Committee, during the upcoming hearings.      Based on our conversation, I am encourage by your willingness      to answer questions about you role and your views in these      matters.       Photographs and reports of prisoner abuse in Iraq and other      locations show an interrogation and detention system      operating contrary to U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions. In      addition to the abhorrent images from the Abu Ghraib prison      that were published last spring, actions that have occurred      with Administration approval include the forcible rendition      of individuals to nations where they may face torture, and      the hiding of ``ghost detainees'' from the International      Committee of the Red Cross. Reports of abuse continue to      emerge. Just this week, The New York Times reported that the      Red Cross has charged U.S. military authorities with using      physical and psychological coercion ``tantamount to torture''      on prisoners at Guantamano Bay. The Washington Post is      reporting that in December 2003 Army generals in Iraq were      warned in a confidential report that members of an elite      military and CIA task force were abusing detainees. According      to The Post, the report concluded that certain arrest and      detention practices could be deemed to be ``technically''      illegal.       In letters dated May 17 and June 15 of this year, I asked      you to describe your role in both the interpretation of the      law and the development of policies that led to what I and      many other consider to have been a disregard for the rule of      law. These letters remain unanswered.       My concerns regarding the abuse of prisoners in U.S.      custody did not begin with these letters. I have been seeking      answers from the Administration for well over a year, before      the abuses at Abu Ghraib came to light. In a very few cases      my questions were answered, but with information that later      proved to be less than accurate. For example, in a news      conference on June 22, 2004, you stated, ``In Iraq, it has      always been U.S. position that Geneva applies. From the early      days of the conflict, both the White House and the      Department of Defense have been very public and clear      about that.''       However, an October 24, 2004, article in The Washington      Post revealed yet another Justice Department memo authorizing      actions that potentially violate the Geneva Conventions. The      draft memo, dated March 19, 2004, apparently was written to      authorize the CIA to transfer detainees out of Iraq for      interrogation--a practice expressly prohibited by the Geneva      Conventions. According to the memo's cover letter, it was      drafted at your request.       In another example, a June 25, 2003, letter from Department      of Defense General Counsel William Haynes stated that the      United States was adhering to its international obligations      including those under the Convention Against Torture. We      later learned of an August 1, 2002, Department of Justice      memorandum that twisted the definition of torture in      unrecognizable ways. That memo was addressed to your. We also      learned months      later of the rendition of a Canadian-Syrian citizen to Syria,      despite his fear of being tortured there, and despite the      Syrian government's well-documented history of torture.      Unnamed CIA officials told the press that this man was in      fact tortured in Syria.       The Committee and the Senate will want to know your role in      these situations and your views with regard to the      development of the legal justifications that appear to      underlie so many of these actions. You will be called upon to      explain in detail your role in developing policies related to      the interrogation and treatment of foreign prisoners. The      American public and the Senate that will be called upon to      confirm your appointment deserve to know how a potential      Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer in the      nation, will interpret and enforce the laws and how you will      develop policy.       We want to know what the current policy on torture is, but      since the Administration disavowed the August 1, 2002, memo,      no public statement of policy has replaced it. Questions      remain unanswered on a host of issues. Requests to the White      House and the Department of Justice for relevant documents--     including my requests to you in May and June of this year--     have been ignored or rejected. I urge you and the      Administration to provide the documents that have been      requested by myself and others without further delay so that      the hearings will be well informed.       Another key concern you will be called upon to discuss is      how you view the duties and responsibilities of the Attorney      General. As we discussed, I view the White House Counsel      position and that of the Attorney General as quite distinct.      You may well have viewed this President as your ``client''      while serving him at the White House, although the courts do      not recognize an attorney-client privilege in that setting.      We will want to know how differently you will act and view      your responsibilities as the Attorney General of the      United States.       Finally, I encourage you to commit to cooperating with all      members of the Judiciary Committee on issues of oversight and      accountability. In the 108th Congress, the Judiciary      Committee failed to fulfill its oversight responsibilities.      Accountability and improving government performance are sound      and long established purposes of congressional oversight, and      accountability has been lacking on these and other crucial      issues. With a new Congress, and a new Attorney General, I      expect a return to the diligent oversight envisioned by our      Founders to ensure that the Executive Branch remains      accountable to the American people.       Our meeting was a constructive beginning at the start of      the confirmation process, and I look forward to your hearing      early next month. In the meantime, Marcelle and I send our      best wishes to you and your family and hope that you have a      restful and rewarding holiday season.

These standards of treatment are important, but they need to be enforced through the military's internal systems of accountability and Congressional oversight, not through lawsuits and adversarial proceedings brought by detainees.

As Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, the military      police commander in Iraq, later recalled it, Miller's bottom      line was blunt: Abu Ghraib should be ``Gitmo-ized.'' Iraqi      detainees should be exposed to the same aggressive techniques      being used to extract information from prisoners in      Guantanamo.       ``You have to have full control,'' Karpinski quoted Miller      as saying. There can be ``no mistake about who's in charge.      You have to treat these detainees like dogs.''       Whether or not Miller actually spoke those words, it is      clear that harsh techniques authorized for a time in      Guantanamo forced nudity, hooding, shackling men in ``stress      positions,'' the use of dogs were taken up in Afghanistan and      Iraq, where they sometimes degenerated into outright      viciousness and even torture. Did the injunction to ``treat      these detainees like dogs'' give rise to a prison culture      that winked at barbarism? Should Miller be held responsible      for what Abu Ghraib became?       The latest Pentagon report on the abuse of captives,      delivered to Congress last week by Vice Admiral Albert Church      III, doesn't point a finger of blame at Miller or any other      high-ranking official. It concludes that while detainees in      Iraq, Guantanamo, and elsewhere were brutalized by military      or CIA interrogators, there was no formal policy authorizing      such abuse. (On occasion it was even condemned in December      2002, for example, some Navy officials denounced the      Guantanamo techniques as ``unlawful and unworthy of the      military services.'')       But surely, Church was asked at a congressional hearing,      someone should be held accountable for the scores of abuses      that even the government admits to? ``Not in my charter,''      the admiral replied.       So the buck stops nowhere. And fresh revelations of horror      keep seeping out.       Afghanistan, 2002: A detainee in the ``Salt Pit'' a secret,      CIA-funded prison north of Kabul is stripped naked, dragged      across a concrete floor, then chained in a cell and left      overnight. By morning, he has frozen to death. According to      The Washington Post, which sourced the story to four US      government officials, the dead man was buried in an unmarked      grave, and his family was never notified. What had the Afghan      done to merit such lethal handling? ``He was probably      associated with people who were associated with Al Qaeda,'' a      US official told the Post.       Iraq, 2003: Manadel al-Jamadi, arrested after a terrorist      bombing in Baghdad, is brought in handcuffs to a shower room      in Abu Ghraib. Shackles are connected from his cuffs to a      barred window, hoisting his arms painfully behind his back a      position so unnatural,       Sergeant Jeffrey Frost later tells investigators, that he      is surprised the man's arms ``didn't pop out of their      sockets.'' Frost and other guards are summoned when an      interrogator complains that al-Jamadi isn't cooperating. They      find him slumped forward, motionless. When they remove the      chains and attempt to stand him on his feet, blood gushes      from his mouth. His ribs are broken. He is dead.       Then there is the government's use of ``extraordinary      rendition,'' a euphemism for      sending terror suspects to be interrogated by other countries      including some where respect for human rights is nonexistent      and interrogation can involve beatings, electric shock, and      other torture. The CIA says it always gets an assurance in      advance that a prisoner will be treated humanely. But of what      value are such assurances when they come from places like      Syria and Saudi Arabia?       Of course the United States must hunt down terrorists and      find out what they know. Better intelligence means more lives      saved, more atrocities prevented, and a more likely victory      in the war against radical Islamist fascism. Those are      crucial ends, and they justify tough means. But they don't      justify means that betray core American values. Interrogation      techniques that flirt with torture to say nothing of those      that end in death cross the moral line that separates us from      the enemy we are trying to defeat.       The Bush administration and the military insist that any      abuse of detainees is a violation of policy and that abusers      are being punished. If so, why does it refuse to allow a      genuinely independent commission to investigate without fear      or favor? Why do Republican leaders on Capitol Hill refuse to      launch a proper congressional investigation? And why do my      fellow conservatives--those who support the war for all the      right reasons--continue to keep silent about a scandal that      should have them up in arms?",1,

,109,0,,,2005-04-21,,59150909a534bbf15ddc16018cbd5a7c,,,EXECUTIVE SESSION,,,"When the Senate confirms Alberto R. Gonzales as U.S.      attorney general, the vote will be the beginning, not the      end, of public debate about our government's policy on      torture.       The Abu Ghraib scandal is only the most visible sign that      this policy is inconsistent. Officially, our government      opposes torture and advocates a universal standard for human      rights. Yet, at the same time, it has allowed ingenious new      interrogation methods to be developed that clearly violate      these standards. They include stress positions, sleep      deprivation, sexual humiliation and desecration of religious      objects. These practices, which should never be used, are no      less traumatic than the infliction of excruciating pain.       For religious people, torture is especially deplorable      because it sins against God and against humanity created in      God's image. It degrades everyone involved--planners,      perpetrators and victims.       More than 225 Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh religious      leaders signed an open letter to Mr. Gonzales. They objected      to his role in developing a narrow definition of torture and      to his equally troubling assertion that some people are not      subject to the protections of international law. They      registered deep concern about our government's moral      foundations, urging support--in practice, not just in words--     for fundamental human rights.       Four steps must now be taken to clarify that our government      has truly abolished torture.       First, Congress must remove the false partition placed      between the military and intelligence services governing      extreme interrogation techniques tantamount to torture. The      Senate was right to pass, nearly unanimously, new      restrictions for the Pentagon, CIA and other intelligence      services. But congressional leaders in both houses later      buckled under White House pressure and scrapped the language      governing intelligence services.       Whether the military or intelligence services are      conducting practices tantamount to torture is of absolutely      no significance. Trying to differentiate between the two      perhaps eases the conscience of decision-makers, but it is a      distinction without a difference. It fails to insulate us      from the absolute evil that is torture.       Second, Congress must outlaw ``extraordinary rendition,'' a      euphemism for torture by proxy. It means that detainees are      secretly transferred to countries where torture is practiced      as a means of interrogation. Although made public only      through shocking cases, such as those of Maher Arar, who was      deported to Syria by the United States, and Mamdouh Habib, an      Australian citizen who was sent to Egypt before being held at      Guantanamo, it has become a mainstay counterterrorism tool.       Does it really need to be said that ``disappearing'' people      without any kind of due process is contrary to everything      America stands for, not to mention our laws and treaties? The      reasons for a detainee's arrest and his guilt or innocence      are irrelevant. No sound moral argument can be made that      enabling torture through rendition is permissible.       Third, Mr. Bush should make a clear statement that torture      is wrong in any form and under any circumstances. He should      state beyond a shadow of doubt that America will not be      complicit in its commission. Leadership from the president      would go a long way toward resolving the torture crisis.        Finally, America needs a special prosecutor. Our reputation      has been so badly damaged by Guantanamo, Bagram and Abu      Ghraib that no other remedy will do. The existing      investigations are not enough because they have not been      truly independent. Organizations such as the American Bar      Association, Amnesty International and the highly respected      International Commission of Jurists in Geneva have all      insisted that an independent investigation is imperative.       Nothing less is at stake in the torture crisis than the      soul of our nation. What does it profit us if we proclaim      high moral values but fail to reject torture? What does it      signify if torture is condemned in word but allowed in deed?      A nation that rewards those who permitted and promoted      torture is approaching spiritual death.

The intent of the memorial is to publicly honor the courage      of those who died in the line of duty, but it also conceals a      deeper story about government in the post-9/11 era: Eight of      the 22 were not CIA officers at all. They were private      contractors.       To ensure that the country's most sensitive duties are      carried out only by people loyal above all to the nation's      interest, federal rules say contractors may not perform what      are called ``inherently government functions.'' But they do,      all the time and in every intelligence and counterterrorism      agency, according to a two-year investigation by The      Washington Post.       What started as a temporary fix in response to the      terrorist attacks has turned into a dependency that calls      into question whether the federal workforce includes too many      people obligated to shareholders rather than the public      interest--and whether the government is still in control of      its most sensitive activities. In interviews last week, both      Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and CIA Director Leon      Panetta said they agreed with such concerns.       The Post investigation uncovered what amounts to an      alternative geography of the United States, a Top Secret      America created since 9/11 that is hidden from public view,      lacking in thorough oversight and so unwieldy that its      effectiveness is impossible to determine.       It is also a system in which contractors are playing an      ever more important role. The Post estimates that out of      854,000 people with top-secret clearances, 265,000 are      contractors. There is no better example of the government's      dependency on them than at the CIA, the one place in      government that exists to do things overseas that no other      U.S. agency is allowed to do.       Private contractors working for the CIA have recruited      spies in Iraq, paid bribes for information in Afghanistan and      protected CIA directors visiting world capitals. Contractors      have helped snatch a suspected extremist off the streets of      Italy, interrogated detainees once held at secret prisons      abroad and watched over defectors holed up in the Washington      suburbs. At Langley headquarters, they analyze terrorist      networks. At the agency's training facility in Virginia, they      are helping mold a new generation of American spies.       Through the federal budget process, the George W. Bush      administration and Congress made it much easier for the CIA      and other agencies involved in counterterrorism to hire more      contractors than civil servants. They did this to limit the      size of the permanent workforce, to hire employees more      quickly than the sluggish federal process allows and because      they thought--wrongly, it turned out--that contractors would      be less expensive.       Nine years later, well into the Obama administration, the      idea that contractors cost less has been repudiated, and the      administration has made some progress toward its goal of      reducing the number of hired hands by 7 percent over two      years. Still, close to 30 percent of the workforce in the      intelligence agencies is contractors.       ``For too long, we've depended on contractors to do the      operational work that ought to be done'' by CIA employees,      Panetta said. But replacing them ``doesn't happen overnight.      When you've been dependent on contractors for so long, you      have to build that expertise over time.'' A second concern of      Panetta's: contracting with corporations, whose      responsibility ``is to their shareholders, and that does      present an inherent conflict.''       Or as Gates, who has been in and out of government his      entire life, puts it: ``You want somebody who's really in it      for a career because they're passionate about it and because      they care about the country and not just because of the      money.''       Contractors can offer more money--often twice as much--to      experienced federal employees than the government is allowed      to pay them. And because competition among firms for people      with security clearances is so great, corporations offer such      perks as BMWs and $15,000 signing bonuses, as Raytheon did in      June for software developers with top-level clearances.       The idea that the government would save money on a contract      workforce ``is a false economy,'' said Mark M. Lowenthal, a      former senior CIA official and now president of his own      intelligence training academy.       As companies raid federal agencies of talent, the      government has been left with the youngest intelligence      staffs ever while more experienced employees move into the      private sector. This is true at the CIA, where employees from      114 firms account for roughly a third of the workforce, or      about 10,000 positions. Many of them are temporary hires,      often former military or intelligence agency employees who      left government service to work less and earn more while      drawing a federal pension.       Across the government, such workers are used in every      conceivable way. Contractors kill enemy fighters. They spy on      foreign governments and eavesdrop on terrorist networks. They      help craft war plans. They gather information on local      factions in war zones. They are the historians, the      architects, the recruiters in the nation's most secretive      agencies. They staff watch centers across the Washington      area. They are among the most trusted advisers to the four-     star generals leading the nation's wars.       So great is the government's appetite for private      contractors with top-secret clearances that there are now      more than 300 companies, often nicknamed ``body shops,'' that      specialize in finding candidates, often for a fee that      approaches $50,000 a person, according to those in the      business.       Making it more difficult to replace contractors with      federal employees: The government doesn't know how many are      on the federal payroll. Gates said he wants to reduce the      number of defense contractors by about 13 percent, to pre-9/     11 levels, but he's having a hard time even getting a basic      head count.       ``This is a terrible confession,'' he said. ``I can't get a      number on how many contractors work for the Office of the      Secretary of Defense,'' referring to the department's      civilian leadership.       The Post's estimate of 265,000 contractors doing top-secret      work was vetted by several high-ranking intelligence      officials who approved of The Post's methodology. The      newspaper's Top Secret America database includes 1.931      companies that perform work at the top-secret level. More      than a quarter of them--533--came into being after 2001, and      others that already existed have expanded greatly. Most are      thriving even as the rest of the United States struggles with      bankruptcies, unemployment and foreclosures.       The privatization of national security work has been made      possible by a nine-year ``gusher'' of money, as Gates      recently described national security spending since the 9/11      attacks.       With so much money to spend, managers do not always worry      about whether they are spending it effectively.       ``Someone says, `Let's do another study,' and because no      one shares information, everyone does their own study,'' said      Elena Mastors, who headed a team studying the al-Qaeda      leadership for the Defense Department. ``It's about how many      studies you can orchestrate, how many people you can fly all      over the place. Everybody's just on a spending spree. We      don't need all these people doing all this stuff.''       Most of these contractors do work that is fundamental to an      agency's core mission. As a result, the government has become      dependent on them in a way few could have foreseen: wartime      temps who have become a permanent cadre.       Just last week, typing ``top secret'' into the search      engine of a major jobs Web site showed 1,951 unfilled      positions in the Washington area, and 19,759 nationwide:      ``Target analyst,'' Reston. ``Critical infrastructure      specialist,'' Washington, D.C. ``Joint expeditionary team      member,'' Arlington.       ``We could not perform our mission without them. They serve      as our `reserves,' providing flexibility and expertise we      can't acquire,'' said Ronald Sanders, who was chief of human      capital for the Office of the Director of National      Intelligence before retiring in February. ``Once they are on      board, we treat them as if they're a part of the total      force.''       The Post's investigation is based on government documents      and contracts, job descriptions, property records, corporate      and social networking Web sites, additional records, and      hundreds of interviews with intelligence, military and      corporate officials and former officials. Most requested      anonymity either because they are prohibited from speaking      publicly or because, they said,      they feared retaliation at work for describing their      concerns.       The investigation focused on top-secret work because the      amount classified at the secret level is too large to      accurately track. A searchable database of government      organizations and private companies was built entirely on      public records. [For an explanation of the newspaper's      decision making behind this project, please see the Editor's      Note.]       The national security industry sells the military and      intelligence agencies more than just airplanes, ships and      tanks. It sells contractors' brain power. They advise, brief      and work everywhere, including 25 feet under the Pentagon in      a bunker where they can be found alongside military personnel      in battle fatigues monitoring potential crises worldwide.       Late at night, when the wide corridors of the Pentagon are      all but empty, the National Military Command Center hums with      purpose. There's real-time access to the location of U.S.      forces anywhere in the world, to granular satellite images or      to the White House Situation Room.       The purpose of all this is to be able to answer any      question the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff might      have. To be ready 24 hours a day, every day, takes five      brigadier generals, a staff of colonels and senior      noncommissioned officers--and a man wearing a pink contractor      badge and a bright purple shirt and tie.       Erik Saar's job title is ``knowledge engineer.'' In one of      the most sensitive places in America, he is the only person      in the room who knows how to bring data from far afield,      fast. Saar and four teammates from a private company, SRA      International, teach these top-ranked staff officers to think      in Web 2.0. They are trying to push a tradition-bound culture      to act differently, digitally.       That sometimes means asking for help in a public online      chat room or exchanging ideas on shared Web pages outside the      military computer networks dubbed .mil--things much resisted      within the Pentagon's self-sufficient culture. ``Our job is      to change the perception of leaders who might drive change,''      Saar said.       Since 9/11, contractors have made extraordinary      contributions--and extraordinary blunders--that have changed      history and clouded the public's view of the distinction      between the actions of officers sworn on behalf of the United      States and corporate employees with little more than a      security badge and a gun.       Contractor misdeeds in Iraq and Afghanistan have hurt U.S.      credibility in those countries as well as in the Middle East.      Abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, some of it done by      contractors, helped ignite a call for vengeance against the      United States that continues today. Security guards working      for Blackwater added fuel to the five-year violent chaos in      Iraq and became the symbol of an America run amok.       Contractors in war zones, especially those who can fire      weapons, blur ``the line between the legitimate and      illegitimate use of force, which is just what our enemies      want,'' Allison Stanger, a professor of international      politics and economics at Middlebury College and the author      of ``One Nation Under Contract,'' told the independent      Commission on Wartime Contracting at a hearing in June.       Misconduct happens, too. A defense contractor formerly      called MZM paid bribes for CIA contracts, sending Randy      ``Duke'' Cunningham, who was a California congressman on the      intelligence committee, to prison. Guards employed in      Afghanistan by ArmorGroup North America, a private security      company, were caught on camera in a lewd-partying scandal.       But contractors have also advanced the way the military      fights. During the bloodiest months in Iraq, the founder of      Berico Technologies, a former Army officer named Guy      Filippelli, working with the National Security Agency.      invented a technology that made finding the makers of      roadside bombs easier and helped stanch the number of      casualties from improvised explosives, according to NSA      officials.       Contractors have produced blueprints and equipment for the      unmanned aerial war fought by drones, which have killed the      largest number of senior al-Qaeda leaders and produced a      flood of surveillance videos. A dozen firms created the      transnational digital highway that carries the drones' real-     time data on terrorist hide-outs from overseas to command      posts throughout the United States.       Private firms have become so thoroughly entwined with the      government's most sensitive activities that without them      important military and intelligence missions would have to      cease or would be jeopardized. Some examples:       *At the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the number      of contractors equals the number of federal employees. The      department depends on 318 companies for essential services      and personnel, including 19 staffing firms that help DHS find      and hire even more contractors. At the office that handles      intelligence, six out of 10 employees are from private      industry.       *The National Security Agency, which conducts worldwide      electronic surveillance, hires private firms to come up with      most of its technological innovations. The NSA used to work      with a small stable of firms; now it works with at least 484      and is actively recruiting more.       *The National Reconnaissance Office cannot produce, launch      or maintain its large satellite surveillance systems, which      photograph countries such as China, North Korea and Iran,      without the four major contractors it works with.       *Every intelligence and military organization depends on      contract linguists to communicate overseas, translate      documents and make sense of electronic voice intercepts. The      demand for native speakers is so great, and the amount of      money the government is willing to pay for them is so huge,      that 56 firms compete for this business.       *Each of the 16 intelligence agencies depends on      corporations to set up its computer networks, communicate      with other agencies' networks, and fuse and mine disparate      bits of information that might indicate a terrorist plot.      More than 400 companies work exclusively in this area,      building classified hardware and software systems.       Hiring contractors was supposed to save the government      money. But that has not turned out to be the case. A 2008      study published by the Office of the Director of National      Intelligence found that contractors made up 29 percent of the      workforce in the intelligence agencies but cost the      equivalent of 49 percent of their personnel budgets. Gates      said that federal workers cost the government 25 percent less      than contractors.       The process of reducing the number of contractors has been      slow, if the giant Office of Naval Intelligence in Suitland      is any example. There, 2,770 people work on the round-the-     clock maritime watch floor tracking commercial vessels, or in      science and engineering laboratories, or in one of four      separate intelligence centers. But it is the employees of 70      information technology companies who keep the place      operating.       They store, process and analyze communications and      intelligence transmitted to and from the entire U.S. naval      fleet and commercial vessels worldwide. ``Could we keep this      building running without contractors?'' said the captain in      charge of information technology. ``No, I don't think we      could keep up with it.''       Vice Adm. David J. ``Jack'' Dorsett, director of naval      intelligence, said he could save millions each year by      converting 20 percent of the contractor jobs at the Suitland      complex to civil servant positions. He has gotten the go-     ahead, but it's been a slow start. This year, his staff has      converted one contractor job and eliminated another--out of      589. ``It's costing me an arm and a leg,'' Dorsett said.       Washington's corridors of power stretch in a nearly      straight geographical line from the Supreme Court to the      Capitol to the White House. Keep going west, across the      Potomac River, and the unofficial seats of power--the      private, corporate ones--become visible, especially at night.      There in the Virginia suburbs are the brightly illuminated      company logos of Top Secret America: Northrop Grumman, SAIC,      General Dynamics.       Of the 1,931 companies identified by The Post that work on      top-secret contracts, about 110 of them do roughly 90 percent      of the work on the corporate side of the defense-     intelligence-corporate world.       To understand how these firms have come to dominate the      post-9/11 era, there's no better place to start than the      Herndon office of General Dynamics. One recent afternoon      there, Ken Pohill was watching a series of unclassified      images, the first of which showed a white truck moving across      his computer monitor.       The truck was in Afghanistan, and a video camera bolted to      the belly of a U.S. surveillance plane was following it.      Pohill could access a dozen images that might help an      intelligence analyst figure out whether the truck driver was      just a truck driver or part of a network making roadside      bombs to kill American soldiers.       To do this, he clicked his computer mouse. Up popped a      picture of the truck driver's house, with notes about      visitors. Another click. Up popped infrared video of the      vehicle. Click: Analysis of an object thrown from the      driver's side. Click: U-2 imagery. Click: A history of the      truck's movement. Click: A Google Earth map of friendly      forces. Click: A chat box with everyone else following the      truck, too.       Ten years ago, if Pohill had worked for General Dynamics,      he probably would have had a job bending steel. Then, the      company's center of gravity was the industrial port city of      Groton, Conn., where men and women in wet galoshes churned      out submarines, the thoroughbreds of naval warfare. Today,      the firm's commercial core is made up of data tools such as      the digital imagery library in Herndon and the secure      BlackBerry-like device used by President Obama, both      developed at a carpeted suburban office by employees in      loafers and heels.       The evolution of General Dynamics was based on one simple      strategy: Follow the money.       The company embraced the emerging intelligence-driven style      of warfare. It developed small-target identification systems      and equipment that could intercept an insurgent's cellphone      and laptop communications. It found ways to sort the billions      of data points collected by intelligence agencies into piles      of information that a single person could analyze.       It also began gobbling up smaller companies that could help      it dominate the new intelligence landscape, just as its      competitors were doing. Between 2001 and 2010, the company      acquired 11 firms specializing in satellites, signals and      geospatial intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance,      technology integration and imagery.       On Sept. 11, 2001, General Dynamics was working with nine      intelligence organizations. Now it has contracts with all 16.      Its      employees fill the halls of the NSA and DHS. The corporation      was paid hundreds of millions of dollars to set up and manage      DHS's new offices in 2003, including its National Operations      Center, Office of Intelligence and Analysis and Office of      Security. Its employees do everything from deciding which      threats to investigate to answering phones.       General Dynamics' bottom line reflects its successful      transformation. It also reflects how much the U.S.      government--the firm's largest customer by far--has paid the      company beyond what it costs to do the work, which is, after      all, the goal of every profit-making corporation.       The company reported $31.9 billion in revenue in 2009, up      from $10.4 billion in 2000. Its workforce has more than      doubled in that time, from 43,300 to 91,700 employees,      according to the company.       Revenue from General Dynamics' intelligence- and      information-related divisions, where the majority of its top-     secret work is done, climbed to $10 billion in the second      quarter of 2009, up from $2.4 billion in 2000, accounting for      34 percent of its overall revenue last year.       The company's profitability is on display in its Falls      Church headquarters. There's a soaring, art-filled lobby,      bistro meals served on china enameled with the General      Dynamics logo and an auditorium with seven rows of white      leather-upholstered seats, each with its own microphone and      laptop docking station.       General Dynamics now has operations in every corner of the      intelligence world. It helps counterintelligence operators      and trains new analysts. It has a $600 million Air Force      contract to intercept communications. It makes $1 billion a      year keeping hackers out of U.S. computer networks and      encrypting military communications. It even conducts      information operations, the murky military art of trying to      persuade foreigners to align their views with U.S. interests.       ``The American intelligence community is an important      market for our company,'' said General Dynamics spokesman      Kendell Pease. ``Over time, we have tailored our organization      to deliver affordable, best-of-breed products and services to      meet those agencies' unique requirements.''       In September 2009, General Dynamics won a $10 million      contract from the U.S. Special Operations Command's      psychological operations unit to create Web sites to      influence foreigners' views of U.S. policy. To do that, the      company hired writers, editors and designers to produce a set      of daily news sites tailored to five regions of the world.      They appear as regular news Web sites, with names such as      ``SETimes.com: The News and Views of Southeast Europe.'' The      first indication that they are run on behalf of the military      comes at the bottom of the home page with the word      ``Disclaimer.'' Only by clicking on that do you learn that      ``the Southeast European Times (SET) is a Web site sponsored      by the United States European Command.''       What all of these contracts add up to: This year, General      Dynamics' overall revenue was $7.8 billion in the first      quarter, Jay L. Johnson, the company's chief executive and      president, said at an earnings conference call in April.      ``We've hit the deck running in the first quarter,'' he said,      ``and we're on our way to another successful year.''       In the shadow of giants such as General Dynamics are 1,814      small to midsize companies that do top-secret work. About a      third of them were established after Sept. 11, 2001, to take      advantage of the huge flow of taxpayer money into the private      sector. Many are led by former intelligence agency officials      who know exactly whom to approach for work.       Abraxas of Herndon, headed by a former CIA spy, quickly      became a major CIA contractor after 9/11. Its staff even      recruited midlevel managers during work hours from the CIA's      cafeteria, former agency officers recall.       Other small and medium-size firms sell niche technical      expertise such as engineering for low-orbit satellites or      long-dwell sensors. But the vast majority have not invented      anything at all. Instead, they replicate what the      government's workforce already does.       A company called SGIS, founded soon after the 2001 attacks,      was one of these.       In June 2002, from the spare bedroom of his San Diego home,      30-year-old Hany Girgis put together an information      technology team that won its first Defense Department      contract four months later. By the end of the year, SGIS had      opened a Tampa office close to the U.S. Central Command and      Special Operations Command, had turned a profit and had 30      employees.       SGIS sold the government the services of people with      specialized skills; expanding the types of teams it could put      together was one key to its growth. Eventually it offered      engineers, analysts and cyber-security specialists for      military, space and intelligence agencies. By 2003, the      company's revenue was $3.7 million. By then, SGIS had become      a subcontractor for General Dynamics, working at the secret      level. Satisfied with the partnership, General Dynamics      helped SGIS receive a top-secret facility clearance, which      opened the doors to more work.       By 2006, its revenue had multiplied tenfold, to $30.6      million, and the company had hired employees who specialized      in government contracting just to help it win more contracts.       ``We knew that's where we wanted to play,'' Girgis said in      a phone interview. ``There's always going to be a need to      protect the homeland.''       Eight years after it began, SGIS was up to revenue of $101      million, 14 offices and 675 employees. Those with top-secret      clearances worked for 11 government agencies, according to      The Post's database.       The company's marketing efforts had grown, too, both in      size and sophistication. Its Web site, for example, showed an      image of Navy sailors lined up on a battleship over the words      ``Proud to serve'' and another image of a Navy helicopter      flying near the Statue of Liberty over the words ``Preserving      freedom.'' And if it seemed hard to distinguish SGIS's work      from the government's, it's because they were doing so many      of the same things. SGIS employees replaced military      personnel at the Pentagon's 24/7 telecommunications center.      SGIS employees conducted terrorist threat analysis. SGIS      employees provided help-desk support for federal computer      systems.       Still, as alike as they seemed, there were crucial      differences.       For one, unlike in government, if an SGIS employee did a      good job, he might walk into the parking lot one day and be      surprised by co-workers clapping at his latest bonus: a      leased, dark-blue Mercedes convertible. And he might say, as      a video camera recorded him sliding into the soft leather      driver's seat, ``Ahhhh . . . this is spectacular.''       And then there was what happened to SGIS last month, when      it did the one thing the federal government can never do.       It sold itself.       The new owner is a Fairfax-based company called Salient      Federal Solutions, created just last year. It is a management      company and a private-equity firm with lots of Washington      connections that, with the purchase of SGIS, it intends to      parlay into contracts.       ``We have an objective,'' says chief executive and      President Brad Antle, ``to make $500 million in five years.''       Of all the different companies in Top Secret America, the      most numerous by far are the information technology, or IT,      firms. About 800 firms do nothing but IT.       Some IT companies integrate the mishmash of computer      systems within one agency; others build digital links between      agencies; still others have created software and hardware      that can mine and analyze vast quantities of data.       The government is nearly totally dependent on these firms.      Their close relationship was on display recently at the      Defense Intelligence Agency's annual information technology      conference in Phoenix. The agency expected the same IT firms      angling for its business to pay for the entire five-day get-     together, a DIA spokesman confirmed.       And they did.       General Dynamics spent $30,000 on the event. On a perfect      spring night, it hosted a party at Chase Field, a 48,569-seat      baseball stadium, reserved exclusively for the conference      attendees. Government buyers and corporate sellers drank beer      and ate hot dogs while the DIA director's morning keynote      speech replayed on the gigantic scoreboard, digital baseballs      bouncing along the bottom of the screen.       Carahsoft Technology, a DIA contractor, invited guests to a      casino night where intelligence officials and vendors ate,      drank and bet phony money at craps tables run by professional      dealers.       The McAfee network security company, a Defense Department      contractor, welcomed guests to a Margaritaville-themed social      on the garden terrace of the hotel across the street from the      convention site, where 250 firms paid thousands of dollars      each to advertise their services and make their pitches to      intelligence officials walking the exhibition hall.       Government officials and company executives say these      networking events are critical to building a strong      relationship between the public and private sectors.       ``If I make one contact each day, it's worth it,'' said Tom      Conway, director of federal business development for McAfee.       As for what a government agency gets out of it: ``Our goal      is to be open and learn stuff,'' said Grant M. Schneider, the      DIA's chief information officer and one of the conference's      main draws. By going outside Washington, where many of the      firms are headquartered, ``we get more synergy. . . . It's an      interchange with industry.''       These types of gatherings happen every week. Many of them      are closed to anyone without a top-secret clearance.       At a U.S. Special Operations Command conference in      Fayetteville, N.C., in April, vendors paid for access to some      of the people who decide what services and gadgets to buy for      troops. In mid-May, the national security industry held a      black-tie evening funded by the same corporations seeking      business from the defense, intelligence and congressional      leaders seated at their tables.       Such coziness worries other officials who believe the post-     9/11 defense-intelligence-corporate relationship has become,      as one senior military intelligence officer described it, a      ``self-licking ice cream cone.''       Another official, a longtime conservative staffer on the      Senate Armed Services Committee, described it as ``a living,      breathing organism'' impossible to control or curtail. ``How      much money has been involved is just mind-boggling,'' he      said. ``We've built such a vast instrument. What are you      going to do with this thing? . . . It's turned into a jobs      program.''       Even some of those gathered in Phoenix criticized the size      and disjointedness of the intelligence community and its      contracting base. ``Redundancy is the unacceptable      norm,'' Lt. Gen. Richard P. Zahner, Army deputy chief of      staff for intelligence, told the 2,000 attendees. ``Are we      spending our resources effectively? . . . If we have not      gotten our houses in order, someone will do it for us.''       On a day that also featured free back rubs, shoeshines, ice      cream and fruit smoothies, another speaker, Kevin P. Meiners,      a deputy undersecretary for intelligence, gave the audience      what he called ``the secret sauce,'' the key to thriving even      when the Defense Department budget eventually stabilizes and      stops rising so rapidly.       ``Overhead,'' Meiners told them--that's what's going to get      cut first. Overhead used to mean paper clips and toner. Now      it's information technology, IT, the very products and      services sold by the businesspeople in the audience.       ``You should describe what you do as a weapons system, not      overhead,'' Meiners instructed. ``Overhead to them--I'm      giving you the secret sauce here--is IT and people. . . . You      have to foot-stomp hard that this is a war-fighting system      that's helping save people's lives every day.''       After he finished, many of the government officials      listening headed to the exhibit hall, where company      salespeople waited in display booths. Peter Coddington, chief      executive of InTTENSITY, a small firm whose software teaches      computers to ``read'' documents, was ready for them.       ``You have to differentiate yourself,'' he said as they      fanned out into the aisles. Coddington had glass beer mugs      and pens twirling atop paperweight pyramids to help persuade      officials of the nation's largest military intelligence      agency that he had something they needed.       But first he needed them to stop walking so fast, to slow      down long enough for him to start his pitch. His twirling      pens seemed to do the job. ``It's like moths to fire,''      Coddington whispered.       A DIA official with a tote bag approached. She spotted the      pens, and her pace slowed. ``Want a pen?'' Coddington called.       She hesitated. ``Ah . . . I have three children,'' she      said.       ``Want three pens?''       She stopped. In Top Secret America, every moment is an      opportunity.       ``We're a text extraction company . . . ,'' Coddington      began, handing her the pens.",1,

These policies not only left a stain on our conscience and America's moral standing, but they also led to the radicalization of countless of individuals. It is well known that Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the leader of IS, spent significant time at American detention centers in Iraq, including Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca. It was there that he and other future leaders of IS first met. Former prison commanders, analysts, and soldiers all reported that these prison sites ``provided a unique setting for both prisoner radicalization and inmate collaboration--and was formative in the development of today's most potent jihadist force.''",1,
,109,0,,,2005-02-03,,2474a50077579a892a609558bd679820,,,EXECUTIVE SESSION,,,"Alberto Gonzales's nomination as attorney general goes      before the Senate at a time when the Republican majority is      eager to provide newly elected President Bush with the      cabinet of his choice, and the Democrats are leery of      exposing their weakened status by taking fruitless stands      against the inevitable. None of that is an excuse for giving      Mr. Gonzales a pass. The attorney general does not merely      head up the Justice Department. He is responsible for      ensuring that America is a nation in which justice prevails.      Mr. Gonzales's record makes him unqualified to take on this      role or to represent the American justice system to the rest      of the world. The Senate should reject his nomination.       The biggest strike against Mr. Gonzales is the now      repudiated memo that gave a disturbingly narrow definition of      torture, limiting it to physical abuse that produced pain of      the kind associated with organ failure or death. Mr.      Gonzales's attempts to distance himself from the memo have      been unconvincing, especially since it turns out he was the      one who requested that it be written. Earlier the same year,      Mr. Gonzales himself sent President Bush a letter telling him      that the war on terror made the Geneva Conventions' strict      limitations on the questioning of enemy prisoners      ``obsolete.''       These actions created the legal climate that made possible      the horrific mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners being held in      Abu Ghraib prison. The Bush administration often talks about      its desire to mend fences with the rest of the world,      particularly the Muslim world. Making Mr. Gonzales the      nation's chief law enforcement officer would set this effort      back substantially.       Other parts of Mr. Gonzales's record are also troubling. As      counsel to George Bush when he was governor of Texas, Mr.      Gonzales did a shockingly poor job of laying out the legal      issues raised by the clemency petitions from prisoners on      death row. And questions have been raised about Mr.      Gonzales's account of how he got his boss out of jury duty in      1996, which allowed Mr. Bush to avoid stating publicly that      he had been convicted of drunken driving.       Senate Democrats, who are trying to define their role after      the setbacks of the 2004 election, should stand on principle      and hold out for a more suitable attorney general.      Republicans also have reason to oppose this nomination. At      the confirmation hearings, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican      of South Carolina, warned that the administration's flawed      legal policies and mistreatment of detainees had hurt the      country's standing and ``dramatically undermined'' the war on      terror. Given the stakes in that war, senators of both      parties should want an attorney general who does not come      with this nominee's substantial shortcomings.",,

                    IN UNITED STATES CUSTODY IN IRAQ",MASSACHUSETTS,1.4218839768026155,"We are in danger of losing something much more important      that just the war in Iraq. We are in danger of losing America      as an instrument of moral authority and inspiration in the      world. I have never known a time in my life when America and      its president were more hated around the world than today. I      was just in Japan, and even young Japanese dislike us. It's      no wonder that so many Americans are obsessed with the finale      of the sitcom ``Friends'' right now. They're the only friends      we have, and even they're leaving.        This administration needs to undertake a total overhaul of      its Iraq policy; otherwise, it is courting a total disaster      for us all.       That overhaul needs to begin with President Bush firing      Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld--today, not tomorrow or      next month, today. What happened in Abu Ghraib prison was, at      best, a fundamental breakdown in the chain of command under      Mr. Rumsfeld's authority, or, at worst, part of a deliberate      policy somewhere in the military-intelligence command of      sexually humiliating prisoners to soften them up for      interrogation, a policy that ran amok.       Either way, the secretary of defense is ultimately      responsible, and if we are going to rebuild our credibility      as instruments of humanitarian values, the rule of law and      democratization, in Iraq or elsewhere, Mr. Bush must hold his      own defense secretary accountable. Words matter, but deeds      matter more. If the Pentagon leadership ran any U.S. company      with the kind of abysmal planning in this war, it would have      been fired by shareholders months ago.       I know that tough interrogations are vital in a war against      a merciless enemy, but outright torture, or this sexual-     humiliation-for-entertainment, is abhorrent. I also know the      sort of abuse that went on in Abu Ghraib prison goes on in      prisons all over the Arab world every day, as it did under      Saddam--without the Arab League or Al Jazeera ever saying a      word about it. I know they are shameful hypocrites, but I      want my country to behave better--not only because it is      America, but also because the war on terrorism is a war of      ideas, and to have any chance of winning we must maintain the      credibility of our ideas.       We were hit on 9/11 by people who believed hateful ideas--     ideas too often endorsed by some of their own spiritual      leaders and educators back home. We cannot win a war of ideas      against such people by ourselves. Only Arabs and Muslims can.      What we could do--and this was the only legitimate rationale      for this war--was try to help Iraqis create a progressive      context in the heart of the Arab-Muslim world where that war      of ideas could be fought out.       But it is hard to partner with someone when you become so      radioactive no one wants to stand next to you. We have to      restore some sense of partnership with the world if we are      going to successfully partner with Iraqis.       Mr. Bush needs to invite to Camp David the five permanent      members of the U.N. Security Council, the heads of both NATO      and the U.N., and the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia      and Syria. There, he needs to eat crow, apologize for his      mistakes and make clear that he is turning a new page.      Second, he needs to explain that we are losing in Iraq, and      if we continue to lose the U.S. public will eventually demand      that we quit Iraq, and it will then become Afghanistan-on-     steroids, which will threaten everyone. Third, he needs to      say he will be guided by the U.N. in forming the new      caretaker government in Baghdad. And fourth, he needs to      explain that he is ready to listen to everyone's ideas about      how to expand our force in Iraq, and have it work under a new      U.N. mandate, so it will have the legitimacy it needs to      crush any uprisings against the interim Iraqi government and      oversee elections--and then leave when appropriate. And he      needs to urge them all to join in.       Let's not lose sight of something--as bad as things look in      Iraq it is not yet lost, for one big reason: America's      aspirations for Iraq and those of the Iraqi silent majority,      particularly Shiites and Kurds, are still aligned. We both      want Iraqi self-rule and then free elections. That overlap of      interests, however clouded, can still salvage something      decent from this war--if the Bush team can finally screw up      the courage to admit its failures and dramatically change      course.       Yes, the hour is late, but as long as there's a glimmer of      hope that this Bush team will do the right thing, we must      insist on it, because America's role in the world is too      precious--to America and to the rest of the world--to be      squandered like this.",1,

Eshoo,109,0,0,100,2005-07-20,-0.42,1e299552a0288f2817d400937e8aa1e9,-0.385,Anna,"FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 2006 AND 2007",CALIFORNIA,0.35091114361905412,"Damascus, Syria.--Seated in his parish office, Father      Sarmad Yousef reflected on his hard choices: to disobey his      archbishop by remaining in Syria or to return to Iraq, where      his name has appeared on a death list. ``After the Americans      came, I was one of the people telling the Iraqi Christians      not to leave,'' he said. ``After the violence started, I      stopped telling them that.''       Christians all over Iraq face a similar dilemma as      relentless violence engulfs the country, some directly      targeting them. Staying in the midst of the threats is      dangerous, yet leaving means abandoning communities, church      property and a heritage with centuries-old roots.       Before the U.S.-led war, roughly 750,000 Christians lived      in Iraq, out of a population of 25 million. Most were      Chaldean and Assyrian, but there also were Armenian, Jacobite      and Greek Orthodox Christians and a small number of      Protestants. Most of them lived either in Baghdad or in      northern Iraq around Mosul.       Since then, 15,000 to 20,000 Christians have fled to Syria,      according to Christian groups, out of ``about 700,000''      Iraqis, most of them in flight from the war, according to the      U.N. high commissioner for refugees.       Yousef, a 30-year-old Chaldean Catholic who came here in      August 2004, was the parish priest of Baghdad's St. Pathion      Church, with 800 families under his stewardship. Today, he      occupies a simple office in Damascus, decorated with small      portraits of St. Therese, the patron saint of his new church,      cradling a bouquet of pink roses.       He says he actively supported the United States when      coalition troops first entered Baghdad in April 2003 and      helped organize community meetings on their behalf. Such      support came with grave risks, and he narrowly missed two      drive-by shooting attacks. But when the Abu Ghraib prison      scandal came to light, Yousef says, his view changed. Nor was      he alone. ``Before that, Iraqis loved Americans,'' said      Yousef, his eyes lowered. ``Directly after that--those      photos, that scandal directly destroyed the dignity of      Iraqis.''       Muneeb, an Iraqi Christian parishioner of St. Therese who      didn't reveal his last name because he said he did not want      to attract local attention, said general resentment toward      the Americans was transferred to Iraqi Christians.      ``Americans are Christians,'' he said, ``so we're      automatically considered to be part of them.''       Christian-owned liquor stores and beauty salons were      attacked. While kidnapping has soared--both for terrorism and      financial gain--Christians felt particularly targeted since      they are often associated with successful businesses and      financial support of families living abroad.       With the rise of Islamic militancy, Muneeb said, his      sister, a doctor, was ordered to wear a veil outside her      home--a requirement that didn't exist, he said, when Saddam      Hussein was in power. ``I never thought of leaving Iraq,''      Muneeb said. ``But as a minority, we have no support.''       Emmanuale Khoshaba, a member of the Assyrian Democratic      Movement, who regularly commutes back and forth to Iraq, is      more optimistic. Through his job as the movement's Syrian      representative, he promoted Iraq's Jan. 30 elections among      absentee voters in Syria.       ``Don't see the glass half-empty,'' said Khoshaba, who is      the organization's Syrian representative. ``Now, we have      rights: We have our names, we have members of the National      Assembly, and we have 35 schools that teach Syriac.'' Under      Hussein, teaching Syriac--the language used by Assyrians and      other Iraqi Christians, and one of the Middle East's oldest      languages--was strictly forbidden.       ``We have coexisted for thousands of years,'' Khoshaba      said. ``The problem was the repressive regime, and today we      are in a transitionary stage. But one has to stay and      sacrifice something for it.''       There have been many examples of such sacrifice.       One Sunday last August, a spate of bombings that struck      five churches in Baghdad and one in Mosul left 11 dead and      scores wounded. Yousef's church was spared, but he said Iraqi      Christians increasingly had started to leave soon after.       When Yousef took a previously planned trip to Damascus, he      learned his was one of 18 names on a death list. Thirteen of      those people had been killed the previous month. ``I decided      not to go back--I felt that I was too young to die,'' said      Yousef. He left behind friends, family and his parish. The      archbishop of Baghdad instructed him return to his post, but      he stayed in Damascus to fill an opening at St. Therese.       Yousef's new church, wedged within Danlascus' Old City of      cobblestone streets and crumbling houses, overflows with      worshipers during Sunday Mass. Of the 2,000 families now      connected to St. Therese, 90 percent are recent Iraqi      refugees. Just outside the church doors, a group of      parishioners from Yousef's old Baghdad parish discussed how      their lives have changed.       ``Life was better--we didn't have any problems,'' said      Jamila Tama, referring to the relative peace between      religious sects under Hussein. ``There's killing, bombing      and kidnapping. We have nothing now--even our house is      sold.''       Her son, Bassam Bahnam, was grateful for the haven in      Syria. ``But I have three boys who worked in Baghdad, and      they're all unemployed now,'' he said.       Bahnam and his family want to return to Iraq--when the      violence ebbs. ``Of course there's no place like home,'' said      his younger brother, Hisham Bahnam. But he criticized      Christian leaders' calls to stay in Iraq. ``They're asking us      to stay, but they're not giving us any solution,'' he said.      ``Even Christian leaders need an army to protect them      whenever they go outside.''       George Abona, a former priest who attended a seminary with      Yousef, agrees. ``When my Christian leaders say, `Don't leave      your heritage,' what are they going offer me?'' he said.      ``What will heritage do for me and my son?''       In Iraq, Abona worked for the United Nations for seven      years, before and during the war, and was in its Baghdad      compound when it was bombed in August 2003. He survived, but      the blast killed his brother, along with the top U.N. envoy      in Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 20 other U.N staffers.       Then last October, he was kidnapped for 19 days. He was      released after another brother paid a $20,000 ransom. Despite      all that, he said, ``The security issue is not a big issue--     it's that I'm not ready to raise my son in an extremist      Islamic society.''       Syria has relaxed immigration rules for its Arab neighbors.      But aside from Palestinians, refugees are not allowed to hold      jobs in Syria, forcing most Iraqi newcomers to live off their      savings. Government assistance--especially health care--is      limited, and the refugees must return home periodically to      get their temporary visas renewed.       Yousef tries to provide his new community in Syria with      food and money for medical needs. The main reason he and      other Christians have fled Iraq, he said, is ``because we      don't feel it is our country any more.''        ``I have bad memories now,'' he said of events since the      invasion. ``Most of my friends were killed there, and we only      saw cruelty and blood. I don't think I'll ever be able to go      back.''",1,

I am particularly concerned about the status of the ongoing      Pentagon investigations. In a Defense Department press      briefing on August 25, 2004, General Paul J. Kern said the      release of Admiral Albert T. Church's report was expected by      September 20, and would ``fill the gaps and seams.'' That      same day, in a separate Pentagon briefing, a senior Army      official said the Church report should be complete by mid-     September and the Formica report ``should be out soon.'' As      of October 29, 2004, neither investigation has been released.      In addition, Lt. Gen. David W. Barno stated in a Pentagon      briefing on October 19, 2004, that the report by Brigadier      General Charles Jacoby is complete, but it has not been      released.       The delay in the completion and public release of these      investigations raises two significant concerns. The first is      whether the investigations were extended due to the discovery      of abuses that previous investigations failed to uncover, or      the discovery of abuses that may have occurred since this      scandal was revealed in April. I recently received a copy of      a letter submitted to Vice Admiral Church suggesting that      abuses by soldiers and/or contractors continued even after      the abuses at Abu Ghraib were reported by the press in late      April. That letter is attached. My second concern is whether      the release of the reports is being delayed for political      reasons. I would like to believe this is unlikely, but      previous experience suggests otherwise. The Schlesinger and      Fay-Jones reports were released in the middle of a month-long      congressional recess, the Army Inspector General's report      received little attention because it was released on the same      day as the 9-11 Commission Report. Without any additional      information, I am forced to wonder whether the remaining      reports are being withheld until a politically expedient      time.       In order to better understand the current status of the      ongoing Pentagon investigations, I ask that you provide the      requested information and respond to the following questions      by November 15, 2004. I have not received a response to the      letter I sent you on October 1, 2004. 1 remain concerned      about the issues raised in that letter, which still awaits      your reply.       1. Please provide the current status and expected      completion and release dates for all ongoing investigations      into the abuse of detainees.       2. Please explain why the investigations conducted by Vice      Admiral Church, Brigadier General Jacoby, and Brigadier      General Formica are delayed beyond their expected completion      and release dates.       3. Has any ongoing investigation discovered incidents of      abuse that were not previously reported by the completed      investigations?       4. Has any ongoing or completed investigation discovered      incidents of abuse that have occurred since the Abu Ghraib      prison abuse scandal was reported by the press on April 28, ",1,

But how      much did Barbara Boxer, Patty Murray or Carol Moseley Braun      really change the world? Now, though, a woman is on the rise      who has already helped reshape geopolitics. Today Condoleezza      Rice will face another round of hearings as she prepares to      be confirmed as secretary of state--a position Thomas      Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe used as a      springboard into the presidency. If Ms. Rice were a Democrat,      the media would have dubbed 2005 the ``year of Condi.''       Ms. Rice has already exerted tremendous influence on world      affairs. As President Bush's national security adviser, she      was instrumental in developing the administration's response      to 9/11 into a policy that involved more than raiding      terrorist camps throughout the world. Ms. Rice, who well      understands the larger global political forces at work since      the end of the Cold War, was one of a handful of powerbrokers      who came to realize the best defense against terrorism was to      spread freedom and democracy in the world.       There has been some public doubt whether Ms. Rice actually      believes in the policies of this administration. But that has      been much wishful thinking by administration critics. Before      the Iraq war, she passionately made the case for removing      Saddam Hussein. Minutes before one speech on the issue--at an      event sponsored by the Manhattan Institute--I had the      opportunity to talk with her one on one about Iraq. What I      quickly realized was that the policy of peace through liberty      was something she cared personally about. Now, as she has      been tapped to head the State Department and after President      Bush dedicated his second inaugural address to the idea that      America's best defense is promoting human liberty, there      should be little doubt as to the central role Ms. Rice has      played and will continue to play in shaping American foreign      policy and the global political landscape.       Ms. Rice has been loyal to Mr. Bush, but she is an      intellectual power in her own right. She has the president's      ear and has been deeply immersed in the movement to halt the      spread of tyranny by waging a war of ideas since long before      Ronald Reagan consigned the Soviet Union to the ash heap of      history. This is the year Ms. Rice steps onto the public      stage; a year her influence and her intellect is no longer      confined to the quiet rooms of power. Her rise deserves to be      celebrated.       That it isn't--and that Senate Democrats instead are      delaying her confirmation--says more about the Bush      administration's opponents than it does about her. Every day      she must face those who would rather that someone like her--     with her intelligence, political savvy and personal appeal      (and anyone who has met her knows, she has a warm, personal      touch)--hadn't come along at all. So they ignore her, deny      her influence or send out a legion of ankle biters who      recycle the same complaints that won John Kerry 251 electoral      votes--mostly that the administration she serves promotes      torture or that she is too much of a hardliner to soothe      relations with other nations.       These criticisms ring hollow, of course. The Abu Ghraib      prosecutions dispel the accusations of systematic torture. As      for soothing relations, either foreign leaders see their      interests in line with the U.S. or the divisions will      persist. France and Germany aren't childishly sulking about      some perceived personal rebuke; they genuinely disagree with      American policies. Only by subverting American foreign policy      could anyone engender the kind of international      ``cooperation'' John Kerry and the Democratic establishment      so desperately seek.       Ms. Rice has persisted in the face of her critics. It is no      wonder then, that some on the right speculate that she will      one day seek elective office--governor or senator in      California, or maybe even the presidency. It is a plausible      idea. A high profile and good character translate into      political power, and she has enough of both to be a political      player. Of course, before doing so she'd have to flesh out      her views on a wide range of domestic subjects. It's also one      of the reasons Democrats would like to tarnish her now,      before she becomes a formidable candidate. It is a fair bet,      though, that Ms. Rice isn't now playing for a new job four      years out. Serving ably as secretary of state is of paramount      importance. Judging by her remarks before the Senate so far,      this is something Ms. Rice clearly understands. Which is why      we should be celebrating this as the year of Condi Rice.",,

In 1942, during World War II, he was promoted to Captain and appointed as the senior officer at the top secret military intelligence post located in Fort Hunt Park, along the George Washington Memorial Parkway. The top secret post was known only by its mailing address, P.O. Box 1142. While there, Captain Kluge led the men and women at the post in reviewing top secret documents and performing interrogations of more than 4,000 important German prisoners of war. Through the efforts of his unit, our military was provided with crucial information that helped end World War II and give the United States an early advantage in the Cold War. Even more impressive were the tactics he used to obtain such information. Rather than physical torture, Captain Kluge honored the Geneva Convention by obtaining information from prisoners through earning their trust. It was a clear contrast from the approach we initially pursued with captured terrorists and suspected terrorists at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib prisons. Through casual conversation, card games, and taking walks, he and his unit were able to extract vital information that led to the discovery of most of Germany's secret weapons programs that included research to develop the atomic bomb, the jet engine, and the V-2 rocket.",1,

                    IN UNITED STATES CUSTODY IN IRAQ",WISCONSIN,0.81811405742396337,"The Horrific abuses by American interrogators and guards at      the Abu Ghraib prison and at other facilities maintained by      the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan can be traced, in      part, to policy decisions and public statements of Secretary      of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. Beginning more than two years      ago, Mr. Rumsfeld decided to overturn decades of previous      practice by the U.S. military in its handling of detainees in      foreign countries. His Pentagon ruled that the United States      would no longer be bound by the Geneva Conventions; that Army      regulations on the interrogation of prisoners would not be      observed; and that many detainees would be held incommunicado      and without      any independent mechanism of review. Abuses will take place      in any prison system. But Mr. Rumsfeld's decisions helped      create a lawless regime in which prisoners in both Iraq and      Afghanistan have been humiliated, beaten, tortured and      murdered--and in which until recently, no one has been held      accountable.       The lawlessness began in January 2002 when Mr. Rumsfeld      publicly declared that hundreds of people detained by U.S.      and allied forces in Afghanistan ``do not have any rights''      under the Geneva Conventions. That was not the case: At a      minimum, all those arrested in the war zone were entitled      under the conventions to a formal hearing to determine      whether they were prisoners of war or unlawful combatants. No      such hearings were held, but then Mr. Rumsfeld made clear      that U.S. observance of the convention was now optional.      Prisoners, he said, would be treated ``for the most part;''      in ``a manner that is reasonably consistent'' with the      conventions--which the secretary breezily suggested, was      outdated.       In one important respect, Mr. Rumsfeld was correct: Not      only could captured al Qaeda members be legitimately deprived      of Geneva Convention guarantees (once the required hearing      was held) but such treatment was in many cases necessary to      obtain vital intelligence and prevent terrorists from      communicating with confederates abroad. But if the United      States was to resort to that exceptional practice. Mr.      Rumsfeld should have established procedures to ensure that it      did so without violating international conventions against      torture and that only suspects who truly needed such      extraordinary handling were treated that way. Outside      controls or independent review could have provided such      safeguards. Instead, Mr. Rumsfeld allowed detainees to be      indiscriminately designated as beyond the law--and made      humane treatment dependent on the goodwill of U.S. personnel.       Much of what has happened at the U.S. detention center in      Guantanamo Bay is shrouded in secrecy. But according to an      official Army report, a system was established at the camp      under which military guards were expected to ``set the      conditions'' for intelligence investigations. The report by      Maj. Gen. Antonio M. Taguba says the system was later      introduced at military facilities at Bagram airbase in      Afghanistan and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, even though it      violates Army regulations forbidding guards to participate in      interrogations.       The Taguba report and others by human right groups reveal      that the detention system Mr. Rumsfeld oversees has become so      grossly distorted that military police have abused or      tortured prisoners under the direction of civilian      contractors and intelligence officers outside the military      chain of command--not in ``exceptional'' cases, as Mr.      Rumsfeld said Tuesday, but systematically. Army guards have      held ``ghost'' prisoners detained by the CIA and even hidden      these prisoners from the International Red Cross. Meanwhile,      Mr. Rumsfeld's contempt for the Geneva Conventions has      trickled down: The Taguba report says that guards at Abu      Ghraib had not been instructed on them and that no copies      were posted in the facility.       The abuses that have done so much harm to the U.S. mission      in Iraq might have been prevented had Mr. Rumsfeld been      responsive to earlier reports of violations. Instead, the      publicly dismissed or minimized such accounts. He and his      staff ignored detained reports by respected human rights      groups about criminal activity at U.S.-run prisons in      Afghanistan, and they refused to provide access to facilities      or respond to most questions. In December 2002, two Afghan      detainees died in events that were ruled homicides by medical      officials; only when the New York Times obtained the story      did the Pentagon confirm that an investigation was underway,      and no results have yet been announced. Not until other media      obtained the photos from Abu Ghraib did Mr. Rumsfeld fully      acknowledge what had happened, and not until Tuesday did his      department disclose that 25 prisoners have died in U.S.      custody in Iraq and Afghanistan. Accountability for those      deaths has been virtually nonexistent: One soldier was      punished with a dishonorable discharge.       On Monday Mr. Rumsfeld's spokesman said that the secretary      had not read Mr. Taguba's report, which was completed in      early March. Yesterday Mr. Rumsfeld told a television      interviewer that he still hadn't finished reading it, and he      repeated his view that the Geneva Conventions ``did not      precisely apply'' but were only ``basic rules'' for handling      prisoners. His message remains the same: that the United      States need not be bound by international law and that the      crimes Mr. Taguba reported are not, for him, a priority. That      attitude has undermined the American military's observance of      basic human rights and damaged this country's ability to      prevail in the war on terrorism.",1,

                        ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006",,,"After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, came widespread shock      and horror--and some tough questions. Could the United States      have prevented this catastrophe? What corrective action might      we take to protect ourselves from other terrorist attacks?       After political struggles and initial resistance by many      political leaders, Congress and the president created the      Sept. 11 commission in 2002. This bipartisan group of 10      prominent Americans was charged with conducting an      independent and complete investigation of the terrorist      attacks of Sept. 11 and with providing recommendations for      preventing such disasters. In July 2004 the commission      released its report, and in December Congress passed      legislation to implement many of its recommendations.       In the spring of 2004, the scandal involving the abuse of      prisoners at Abu Ghraib became public. Additional allegations      of abuse surfaced in connection with prisoners detained by      the United States at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and elsewhere.      Many Americans asked themselves the same painful questions      about these allegations: How could such terrible actions have      taken place? Who was responsible? What reforms might we      implement to prevent such problems? Once again, a year later,      these questions remain unanswered.       We believe that the American public deserves answers. We      are members of the bipartisan Liberty and Security Initiative      of the Constitution Project, which is based at Georgetown      University's Public Policy Institute. We have joined with      other members of the initiative--Republicans and Democrats,      liberals and conservatives--to call for the establishment of      an independent bipartisan commission to investigate the issue      of abuse of terrorist suspects. We urge Congress and the      president to immediately create such a commission and to use      the Sept. 11 commission as a model.       No investigation completed to date has included      recommendations on how mistreatment at detention facilities      might be avoided. Even the Pentagon's much-heralded report by      Vice Adm. Albert T. Church, completed in March, concluded      only that there were ``missed opportunities in the policy      development process'' and that these opportunities ``should      be considered in the development of future interrogation      policies.''       Establishing an independent, bipartisan commission would      also be beneficial for U.S. relationships abroad. The abuse      of terrorist suspects in U.S. custody has undermined the      United States' position in the world. This is a time when we      should be making extra efforts to reach out to Muslims and to      ask them to work with us in the war against terrorism.      Instead, our failure to undertake a thorough and credible      investigation has created severe resentment of the United      States.       An independent bipartisan investigation can generate      widespread acceptance and support for its findings. Only with      such a commission are we likely to enact the reforms needed      to restore our credibility among the nations of the world.       We must move beyond the partisan battles of our highly      charged political climate. To provide a credible      investigation and a plan for corrective action, and to show      the world that the United States takes seriously its      obligations to uphold the rule of law, we urge Congress and      the president to establish a commission to investigate abuse      of terrorist suspects.",,

Bush, in violation of his constitutional oath to      faithfully execute the office of President of the United      States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect,      and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in      violation of his constitutional duty under Article II,      Section 3 of the Constitution ``to take care that the laws be      faithfully executed'', has both personally and acting through      his agents and subordinates, together with the Vice      President, violated United States and International Law and      the U.S. Constitution by secretly authorizing and encouraging      the use of torture against captives in Afghanistan, Iraq in      connection with the so-called ``war'' on terror.       In violation of the Constitution, U.S. law, the Geneva      Conventions (to which the U.S. is a signatory), and in      violation of basic human rights, torture has been authorized      by the President and his administration as official policy.      Water-boarding, beatings, faked executions, confinement in      extreme cold or extreme heat, prolonged enforcement of      painful stress positions, sleep deprivation, sexual      humiliation, and the defiling of religious articles have been      practiced and exposed as routine at Guantanamo, at Abu Ghraib      Prison and other U.S. detention sites in Iraq, and at Bagram      Air Base in Afghanistan. The president, besides bearing      responsibility for authorizing the use of torture, also as      Commander in Chief, bears ultimate responsibility for the      failure to halt these practices and to punish those      responsible once they were exposed.       The administration has sought to claim the abuse of      captives is not torture, by redefining torture. An August 1,      2002 memorandum from the Administration's Office of Legal      Counsel Jay S. Bybee addressed to White House Counsel Alberto      R. Gonzales concluded that to constitute torture, any pain      inflicted must be akin to that accompanying ``serious      physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily      function, or even death.'' The memorandum went on to state      that even should an act constitute torture under that minimal      definition, it might still be permissible if applied to      ``interrogations undertaken pursuant to the President's      Commander-in-Chief powers.'' The memorandum further asserted      that ``necessity or self-defense could provide justifications      that would eliminate any criminal liability.''       This effort to redefine torture by calling certain      practices simply ``enhanced interrogation techniques'' flies      in the face of the Third Geneva Convention Relating to the      Treatment of Prisoners of War, which states that ``No      physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion,      may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them      information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse      to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to any      unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.''       Torture is further prohibited by the Universal Declaration      of Human Rights, the paramount international human rights      statement adopted unanimously by the United Nations General      Assembly, including the United States, in 1948. Torture and      other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is      also prohibited by international treaties ratified by the      United States: the International Covenant on Civil and      Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention Against Torture      and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ",,

An investigation by SBS's Dateline program, to be aired      tonight, filmed the burning of the bodies.       It also filmed a U.S. Army psychological operations unit      broadcasting a message boasting of the burnt corpses into a      village believed to be harbouring Taliban.       According to an SBS translation of the message, delivered      in the local language, the soldiers accused Taliban fighters      near Kandahar of being ``cowardly dogs''. ``You allowed your      fighters to be laid down facing west and burnt. You are too      scared to retrieve their bodies.

The erosion of America's soft      power has made it more difficult for the U.S. to succeed in      preventing or containing threats of terrorism, genocide, and      nuclear proliferation. The denigration of American values has      made the U.S. ineffective in promoting human rights and      democracy. Indeed, the current administration's frequent      disregard of the rule of law has jeopardized five frequently      stated foreign-policy objectives.       The first is countering the threats posed by Iraq, Iran,      and Afghanistan. For more than a decade these countries have      topped the United States' list of dangers to international      security. Strategies to reduce the violence and terrorism in      Iraq and Afghanistan and to prevent Iran from exporting      terrorism and acquiring nuclear weapons require a mixture of      hard and soft power. But reports of CIA and U.S. military      torture and mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and other      secret prisons in the region may have weakened the ability of      the U.S. to counter the deterioration of human-rights      conditions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Similarly, State      Department criticism of the Iranian regime's political      repression has been blunted by the U.S. record of detainee      abuse and illegal electronic surveillance. Years after the      U.S. military interventions, Iraq and Afghanistan remain      major exporters of terrorism and centers of human-rights      abuse. Iran is a major terrorist exporter and a human-rights      disaster.       A second major stated objective of U.S. foreign policy is      preventing genocide. The lesson of Rwanda was that the cost      of failing to stop genocide is not only a massive killing of      innocent civilians but also an ongoing humanitarian      catastrophe and long-term regional instability. Following the      Rwanda genocide, a doctrine of humanitarian intervention was      developed under U.S. leadership and invoked, with broad      international support and authority under the Genocide      Convention, to end the genocide in Bosnia in 1995, and then      to prevent a genocide in Kosovo in 1999. Today, that doctrine      is in shambles, undermined and discredited by the Bush      administration's intervention in Iraq. As a result, the U.S.      has been unable to mobilize support to stop the ongoing      genocide in Darfur and an entire region of Africa has been      destabilized.       Addressing the challenges posed by geopolitical rivals such      as China, Russia, and Cuba is a third long-standing concern      of U.S. foreign policy. The Bush record has made already-     complicated interactions with these countries even more      difficult. China is leading the way in effectively exploiting      the growing global perception that the U.S. is a human-rights      violator. For several years the Chinese government has      produced and publicized its own report on U.S. human-rights      failings in an attempt to counter U.S. criticism of China's      record. China's March 2007 report was particularly blunt:      ``We urge the U.S. government to acknowledge its own human      rights problems and stop interfering in other countries'      internal affairs under the pretext of human rights.'' Russian      President Vladimir Putin has been similarly direct in      rejecting recent U.S. criticism of the Russian government's      press censorship, and Cuba has been quick to point to the      U.S. record of detainee abuse at Guantanamo whenever Cuban      human-rights practices are challenged by the U.S. The Bush      administration has provided China, Russia, and Cuba with a      convenient excuse for cracking down on dissidents and      minorities under the guise of fighting terrorism within their      borders.       Creating and managing strategic alliances is a fourth major      U.S. foreign-policy objective. The Bush administration's      record on human rights and the rule of law has alienated      traditional democratic allies and complicated relations with      authoritarian countries. The Council of Europe, a      parliamentary assembly of elected representatives from across      the continent, has condemned European governments for      cooperating with the U.S. in running secret detention      centers, and has called for Europe to distance itself from      the Bush administration's tactics in the ``war on terror.''      Negative European opinion about U.S. human-rights practices      has made it politically difficult for European leaders to      support U.S. positions on other issues. And by condoning      torture, prisoner abuse, secret detention, illegal      surveillance, and other violations of human rights, the      administration has also undercut its ability to promote      reform with authoritarian allies like Egypt, Saudi Arabia,      Morocco, and Uzbekistan.       Finally, holding accountable those who commit human-rights      crimes has been a bedrock objective of U.S. foreign policy      since the Nuremberg trials following World War II. The U.S.      has long been at the forefront of efforts to create a system      of international justice, most recently in the establishment      of the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former      Yugoslavia and Rwanda. By opposing the International Criminal      Court, the Bush administration has relinquished its      leadership on these issues. The indispensability of      international justice to U.S. foreign policy is illustrated      by the administration's retreat in 2006 from outright      opposition to the ICC to reluctant acceptance of the U.N.      Security Council's referral of the Darfur genocide case to      ICC jurisdiction. But this begrudging exception unfortunately      proves the rule.",,

Ricardo Sanchez, faulted by some for      leadership failures in the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal,      has been cleared by the Army of all allegations of wrongdoing      and will not be punished, officials said.       Three officers who were among Sanchez's top deputies during      the period of the prisoner abuse in the fall of 2003 also      have been cleared. An Army Reserve one-star general has been      reprimanded, and the outcome of seven other senior Army      officer cases could not be learned Friday.       Sanchez, who became the senior U.S. commander in Iraq in      June 2003, two months after the fall of Baghdad, has not been      accused of criminal violations. It is unclear, however,      whether the controversy surrounding his role in Iraq will      stand in the way of his earning a fourth star. He is nearing      the end of his tenure as commander of the Army's 5th Corps,      based in Germany.       After assessing the allegations against Sanchez and taking      sworn statements from 37 people, the Army's inspector      general, Lt. Gen. Stanley E. Green, concluded that the      allegations were unsubstantiated, according to officials      familiar with the details of Green's probe.       Green reached the same conclusion in the cases of two      generals and a colonel who worked on Sanchez's staff.       The 'officials who disclosed the findings spoke only on      condition of anonymity because the results on Sanchez and 11      other officers who were the subject of Green's scrutiny have      not yet been publicly released and Congress has not been      fully briefed.       The question of accountability among senior Army and      Defense Department officials who were in positions of      responsibility on Iraq detention and interrogation policy has      been hotly debated in Congress. Some Democrats accuse the      Pentagon of foisting all the blame onto low-ranking soldiers.       In a statement issued Friday that did not mention Sanchez      or other specific cases, Sen. John Warner, chairman of the      Senate Armed Services Committee, said that as soon as all      Pentagon assessments of accountability are complete he will      hold a committee hearing ``to examine the adequacy of those      reviews'' and to hear senior civilian and military officials      address the issue.       Warner, R-Va., said he strongly agrees with one      investigation report that concluded last year that commanders      should be held accountable for their action or inaction and      that military as well as civilian leaders in the Pentagon      ``share this burden of responsibility.''       The office of Michigan Sen. Carl Levin, the ranking      Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, declined to      comment on the matter.       Asked about public expectations of punishment for senior      officers associated with Abu Ghraib, the Army's chief public      affairs officer, Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks, said the Army      went to great lengths to make its investigations thorough and      fair.       In addition to clearing Sanchez, the Army inspector general      has determined that there should be no punishment given to      Sanchez's former top deputy, Maj. Gen. Walter Wojdakowski; to      Maj. Gen. Barbara Fast, who was Sanchez's intelligence chief      in Baghdad; or to Col. Mark Warren, Sanchez's top legal      adviser at the time.       In an interview Friday, three senior defense officials      associated with the Green investigations cited mitigating      circumstances in the Sanchez case, including the fact that      his organization in Iraq, known as Combined Joint Task Force      7, initially was short of the senior officers it required.      They also cited the upsurge in insurgent violence shortly      after Sanchez took command and the intense pressure the      military faced in hunting down Saddam Hussein.       The three officials spoke on condition of anonymity.       A separate investigation by a panel headed for former      Defense Secretary James Schlesinger concluded that Sanchez      should have taken stronger action in November 2003 when he      realized the extent of problems among the military      intelligence and military police units running Abu Ghraib.

I'd always conclude by saying, ``I know you won't remember      everything I told you today, but just remember what your mom      told you: Do unto others as you would have others do unto      you.'' That's a pretty good standard for life and for the      law, and even though I left the unit in 1995, I like to think      that some of my teaching had carried over when the 72nd      refused to participate in misconduct at Iraq's Abu Ghraib      prison.       Sometimes, though, the questions we face about detainees      and interrogation get more specific. One such set of      questions relates to ``waterboarding.''       That term is used to describe several interrogation      techniques. The victim may be immersed in water, have water      forced into the nose and mouth, or have water poured onto      material placed over the face so that the liquid is inhaled      or swallowed. The media usually characterize the practice as      ``simulated drowning.'' That's incorrect. To be effective,      waterboarding is usually real drowning that simulates death.      That is, the victim experiences the sensations of drowning:      struggle, panic, breath-holding, swallowing, vomiting, taking      water into the lungs and, eventually, the same feeling of not      being able to breathe that one experiences after being      punched in the gut. The main difference is that the drowning      process is halted. According to those who have studied      waterboarding's effects, it can cause severe psychological      trauma, such as panic attacks, for years.       The United States knows quite a bit about waterboarding.      The U.S. government--whether acting alone before domestic      courts, commissions and courts-martial or as part of the      world community--has not only condemned the use of water      torture but has severely punished those who applied it.       After World War II, we convicted several Japanese soldiers      for waterboarding American and Allied prisoners of war. At      the trial of his captors, then-Lt. Chase J. Nielsen, one of      the 1942 Army Air Forces officers who flew in the Doolittle      Raid and was captured by the Japanese, testified: ``I was      given several types of torture. . . . I was given what they      call the water cure.'' He was asked what he felt when the      Japanese soldiers poured the water. ``Well, I felt more or      less like I was drowning,'' he replied, ``just gasping      between life and death.''       Nielsen's experience was not unique. Nor was the      prosecution of his captors. After Japan surrendered, the      United States organized and participated in the International      Military Tribunal for the Far East, generally called the      Tokyo War Crimes Trials. Leading members of Japan's military      and government elite were charged, among their many other      crimes, with torturing Allied military personnel and      civilians. The principal proof upon which their torture      convictions were based was conduct that we would now call      waterboarding.       In this case from the tribunal's records, the victim was a      prisoner in the Japanese- occupied Dutch East Indies:       A towel was fixed under the chin and down over the face.      Then many buckets of water were poured into the towel so that      the water gradually reached the mouth and rising further      eventually also the nostrils, which resulted in his becoming      unconscious and collapsing like a person drowned. This      procedure was sometimes repeated 5-6 times in succession.       The United States (like Britain, Australia and other      Allies) pursued lower-ranking Japanese war criminals in      trials before their own tribunals. As a general rule, the      testimony was similar to Nielsen's. Consider this account      from a Filipino waterboarding victim:       Q: Was it painful?       A: Not so painful, but one becomes unconscious. Like      drowning in the water.       Q: Like you were drowning?       A: Drowning --you could hardly breathe.       Here's the testimony of two Americans imprisoned by the      Japanese: They would lash me to a stretcher then prop me up      against a table with my head down. They would then pour about      two gallons of water from a pitcher into my nose and mouth      until I lost consciousness. And from the second prisoner:      They laid me out on a stretcher and strapped me on. The      stretcher was then stood on end with my head almost touching      the floor and my feet in the air. . . . They then began      pouring water over my face and at times it was almost      impossible for me to breathe without sucking in water.       As a result of such accounts, a number of Japanese prison-     camp officers and guards were convicted of torture that      clearly violated the laws of war. They were not the only      defendants convicted in such cases. As far back as the U.S.      occupation of the Philippines after the 1898 Spanish-American      War, U.S. soldiers were court-martialed for using the ``water      cure'' to question Filipino guerrillas.       More recently, waterboarding cases have appeared in U.S.      district courts. One was a civil action brought by several      Filipinos seeking damages against the estate of former      Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos. The plaintiffs claimed      they had been subjected to torture, including water torture.      The court awarded $766 million in damages, noting in its      findings that ``the plaintiffs experienced human rights      violations including, but not limited to . . . the water      cure, where a cloth was placed over the detainee's mouth and      nose, and water producing a drowning sensation.''       In 1983, federal prosecutors charged a Texas sheriff and      three of his deputies with violating prisoners' civil rights      by forcing confessions. The complaint alleged that the      officers conspired to ``subject prisoners to a suffocating      water torture ordeal in order to coerce confessions. This      generally included the placement of a towel over the nose and      mouth of the prisoner and the pouring of water in the towel      until the prisoner began to move, jerk, or otherwise indicate      that he was suffocating and/or drowning.''       The four defendants were convicted, and the sheriff was      sentenced to 10 years in prison.       We know that U.S. military tribunals and U.S. judges have      examined certain types of water-based interrogation and found      that they constituted torture. That's a lesson worth      learning. The study of law is, after all, largely the study      of history. The law of war is no different. This history      should be of value to those who seek to understand what the      law is--as well as what it ought to be.",,

Since      its creation as a prison facility in 2002, Camp X-ray has      faced consistent criticism from groups such as Amnesty      International (AI) which claim U.S. officials have sanctioned      illegal practices at the facility. Prisoner testimony and      photographs have established that suspected al Qaeda      detainees have been held without trial or proper legal      representation and may have suffered some of the same torture      tactics that took place at the now infamous Abu Ghraib prison      in Iraq. AI alleged in its report that ``despite public      commitments to the humane treatment of detainees, it      subsequently has been revealed that the U.S. administration's      decision not to apply provisions of the Geneva Conventions to      those being held in Guantanamo may have been motivated by a      desire to apply harsher interrogation techniques than it      perceived would be allowed under the Geneva Conventions.''

Clearly, from his point of view, it is the defining battle in terms of his goals and ambition for the al-Qaida movement. The reason al-Qaida came into Iraq was to make sure we would lose, that moderation would fail. Their worst nightmare is for a mother to have a say about her children, and if we can pull this off in Iraq, where the different groups--the Sunnis, the Shias, and the Kurds--can live together under the rule of law, have a central government and local governments that work together and allow people to raise their children without fear and prosper together and a woman has a say about her children, that is an absolute nightmare for al-Qaida. They see the outcome in Iraq as very important to their agenda. I hope we are smart enough to see the outcome in Iraq in terms of our own national security because I have said a thousand times, you cannot kill the terrorists and win this war. Killing terrorists is a part of this war. The war is an ideological struggle. The high ground in this war is the moral high ground. That is why Abu Ghraib hurt so badly. That is why we have to, at every turn, showcase our values as being different from our enemy's. When we capture an al-Qaida operative, it becomes about us.

And what a joy it      still is to say those two words together. Minnesota's new      senator already is bringing even more distinction to the seat      that Hubert Humphrey held. She is another star who was      mentored by Fritz Mondale, and she is upholding that grand      DFL tradition.       When I was asked if I could be here with you, I was more      than glad to clear my calendar to do it. It is a special      honor and a great pleasure to be here with you in recognition      of the service, the historical significance, and the 80th      anniversary year of a friend, a former colleague, and an      American statesman.       In this room we know him as ``Fritz.'' Others call him      Walter. When he was a halfback in high school, they called      him ``Crazylegs Mondale'' for some reason. He has also gone      by Mr. Attorney General, Senator, Mr. Vice President, Mr.      Ambassador, and Dad. I think I like Crazylegs best. I can't      wait to ask him about how that happened.       The history of the era of his public service has not yet      taken full form for the ages, but even now Fritz Mondale      looms large as a model and as a catalyst, in his roles in the      Senate and as Vice President.       I have been asked to focus particularly on his time in the      Senate.       Walter Mondale is sometimes described as the paradigm      figure of the transition between two eras--the FDR Coalition      up to the War in Vietnam, and the social ferment that came      after the war. And perhaps this is so. But to me, who Fritz      Mondale is, and what he stands for, are just as important as      when he stood there. Deep echoes resonate throughout his      service of the first principles of our Republic. The issues      he led on then are as fresh as today's news, and as enduring      as our founding documents.       Issues like the concentration and abuse of power. Or social      and economic justice and the consolidation of wealth in the      pockets and portfolios of just a few. Or the role of      government in protecting the little guy when powerful market      forces run roughshod. Or the tension between freedom and      security. Or the challenge of achieving energy security. Or      the very roles of both the Senate and the Office of the Vice      President in the American system. Even the question of      whether a woman ever could credibly assume the highest      office in the land. Trace any of these issues back in      time, and you will find Fritz Mondale at earlier decision      points. For example, just imagine how loose from our      moorings we might be right now without the guideposts of      the FISA law, which resulted from the investigation that      he, Frank Church and others launched into earlier abuses      of the power of government to snoop into Americans' lives.       Here is something to which we all can attest. Fritz Mondale      is a good man whose decency elevated every institution in      which he served. Who he is has everything to do with what he      achieved.       Clarence once said that his brother's politics were, as he      put it, ``an extension of our father's preaching,'' and I can      see that. Their father, the farmer-turned-minister, felt and      saw the ravages of the Great Depression on the farms and the      communities of the heartland. And when Fritz entered      politics, he did it for the right reasons, to make life      better for the people.       In the Senate we mostly chalked Fritz's personality up to      clean air, clean living and Norwegian genes. He was and is      well liked on both sides of the aisle. Fritz's dad taught him      that your integrity is everything, and the lesson stuck. He      kept his word and everyone trusted him. He was always well      prepared. And he surrounded himself with good and competent      people. He had one of the best staffs on the Hill, and it's a      treat to see some of those staffers sprinkled around the room      today.       I've known Fritz a long while, but you still pick up some      new perspectives in preparing for an occasion like this. I      knew he was avid about hunting and fishing in the North      Woods, but I hadn't known his reputation for being such a      good ``bull cook.''       I looked it up. A bull cook is the fellow stuck with doing      the chores around camp, cutting fuel, cleaning up and      cooking. But when he rings the bell in the morning, everyone      has to get up. I think that after being in a place like the      Senate where no one is able to give orders that stick, Fritz      likes that sense of real power when he rings that bell.       One side of Fritz that the public did not see as readily as      we did in the Senate was his sense of humor--one of the best      I have ever known. In many a tense moment, his sense of humor      often defused the tension and restored the spirit of comity      that is so crucial in getting things done in the Senate.       I wish the American people had seen more of that side of      Fritz Mondale. Mike Berman told Fritz's biographer Finlay      Lewis that the staff was always urging Fritz to loosen up in      public. Mike said, ``I can't count the number of lit cigars I      have stuffed in my pocket over the years.''       He loved the Senate, and the Senate loved him back. He once      said that he ``found his sweet spot'' in the Senate. He was a      quick learner and craved learning new things. He said the      Senate ``was like mainlining human nature.'' And it's true.      You pick up any day's Congressional Record, and it's like      America's newspaper. Whatever is happening in      the country or the world on any given day is being talked      about and sometimes even acted on in the United States      Senate.       His first major legislative achievement was a 1966 law to      make automakers notify car owners of dangerous defects. He      went on to win another victory for consumers by stepping up      regulation of slaughterhouses that had been selling diseased      and putrid meat.       But he really came into his own in mastering the      legislative process with a key victory on his open housing      bill. Part of his success in winning a key cloture vote,      against great odds, was helped along by his earlier bonding      with a crusty earlier chairman of the Judiciary Committee,      James Eastland. I hasten to note that I haven't yet entered      into my crusty phase. Fritz knew the art of being able to      disagree without being disagreeable.       That was a heady and vibrant legislative era, and Fritz had      a hand in virtually every major piece of civil rights,      education and child care legislation that emerged from      Congress during that period.       To me, part of his Senate legacy that is the most      significant and timely--timely, even today--was his work on      and after the Senate's investigation--headed by Senator Frank      Church--into the abuses that led to the spying on the      American people by their own government. The FBI's COINTELPRO      operation, for instance, had spent more than two decades      searching in vain for communist influence in the NAACP, and      they had infiltrated domestic groups like organizations that      advocated for women's rights.       More than any other member of the special committee, Fritz      Mondale mastered the issues and dug into the research, which      spanned testimony from 800 witnesses and more than one      hundred thousand classified pages. The evidence added up, in      his words, to ``a road map to the destruction of American      democracy.'' Powerful government surveillance tools were      misused against the American people. There had been little      effective congressional oversight of these federal      investigative and intelligence agencies, and too little      judicial review.       Their work led to the creation of the Select Committee on      Intelligence, and later, to the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act--the FISA law that only lately has entered      the public lexicon.       Then, as now, in the name of security, some were willing to      trade away the people's rights. Then, as now, some would have      the United States of America stoop to the level of our      enemies, giving them a victory over us that they could not      achieve on their own.       The parallels with today are clear and so are the lessons,      but Fritz freshened the bottom line for us in his address to      Senators not long after 9/11, as part of the Senate's leaders      lecture series. Even before Abu Ghraib, the disclosure of the      torture memos, the revelations about unlawful surveillance of      Americans, or White House political tampering with U.S.      Attorneys, this is what he said in September, 2002: ``There      is always the danger that our fears will overcome our faith      in the power of justice and accountability. Whenever we have      gone down that road, we have hurt the innocent and      embarrassed ourselves. Justice and accountability make us      better able to face our enemies. Justice strengthens us.''      Unquote, and amen.       Another of Fritz Mondale's most remarkable and lasting      achievements in the Senate was to engineer a change in the      Senate's rules, to curb the abuse of filibusters in thwarting      the will of clear majorities of the American people. The      difficulty in passing the civil rights laws of the 60s had      gradually convinced more and more Senators that the bar for      cutting off debate in the Senate was set too high.       That might not sound difficult, but changing the way the      Senate operates is something akin to trying to change the      weather.       As a freshman Senator, I had a front seat and a bit part in      Fritz's highly organized campaign to change the cloture rule.       He and Republican Senator James Pearson of Kansas launched      the effort to change cloture from two-thirds to three-fifths.      Fritz preceded and followed that launch by carefully laying      the groundwork, enlisting Senators one by one. When it      finally reached the Senate Floor, the debate itself was      protracted. Finlay Lewis set the scene well in describing      part of the debate. Quoting him, ``To an uninitiated or      casual visitor, the proceedings must have seemed arcane, even      bizarre. Here was the world's greatest deliberative body      solemnly voting to table the Lord's Prayer. At another point,      the Senate became polarized over a murky motion to table a      motion to reconsider a vote to table an appeal of a ruling      that a point of order was NOT in order against a motion to      table another point of order against a motion to bring to a      vote a motion to call up a resolution that would change the      rules. At least, that's what it sounded like.'' Unquote.       Late, late one night, at about this point in the debate,      Fritz and Majority Leader Mike Mansfield enlisted me, a young      whippersnapper, to play a role. They asked me to stay on the      floor one night around two in the morning to take the gavel      as the presiding officer. They expected that a lot of tight      rulings were coming up. But I felt the honor of the calling      drain away as Mansfield explained that they needed someone      big who was still awake to be in the chair for those rulings.      Sometimes a Senator is no more than a conscious body in the      right place at the right time.       The debate went on and on and on, and so did the      parliamentary and coalition-building by Fritz and by his      opponents. Relationships and Senate comity were being tested.      Before they reached the breaking point, Fritz rightly knew      when to strike a compromise, and he worked one out with      Russell Long.       He won the change in the cloture rule, and it is not an      exaggeration to point out that his efforts probably saved the      Senate as we know it, and he did it without changing the      Senate's fundamental character. As difficult as it still is      to get things done in the Senate, without the Mondale cloture      rule the Senate by now would be largely unmanageable.       It is saddening and frustrating today to see that even the      Mondale rule has been abused. Filibusters are used far more      often than they used to be. We had to have 72 cloture votes      last year, and with a razor thin majority like the current      Democratic majority in the Senate, that usually is an      insurmountable hurdle. As Fritz knows and as Fritz      practiced, the Senate's machinery is oiled by good will      and self restraint, and there is less and less of that      around.       Through his public service, Fritz Mondale invested himself      in the belief that our democracy offers civilizing power to      all of us together as a community, through our representative      government, to give each of us, and all of us, the      opportunity to thrive, to make justice real, and to make the      economy work for all and not just for some.       In a time when government is compiling more and more      information about every American, every American deserves to      know what their government is doing. Checks and balances and      the kind of oversight that Fritz Mondale believes in and      practiced makes government more accountable to the people. It      helps make our system work as the Framers intended.       This is the way he put it in that address in 2002: ``What a      paradise we would live in if trust were never abused. But our      Founders knew better. They built our system on this deep      insight into human nature. We are not perfect. We are, all of      us, mixtures of the good and base, lofty and lowly, selfless      and selfish. We are capable of sonatas, sonnets, and      cathedrals. But we are also capable of greed, paranoia, and a      dangerous thirst for power.'' Unquote. That insight of the      Framers, he concluded, accounts for our unique system of      checks and balances.       The Senate at its best can be the conscience of the nation.      I have seen that when it happens, and I marvel in the      fundamental soundness and wisdom of our system every time it      does. But we cannot afford to put any part of the mechanism      on automatic pilot. It takes constant work and vigilance to      keep our system working as it should for the betterment of      our society and its people. Keeping faith with these      fundamentals accounts for much of the legacy of Fritz      Mondale.       It is easy for politicians to appeal to our worst instincts      and to our selfishness. Political leaders serve best when      they appeal to the best in us, to lift our sights, summon our      will and raise us to a higher level.       This year we celebrate our good fortune of knowing and      benefiting from Fritz Mondale's ample service to the nation,      and there is much to celebrate. His is the generous and      optimistic spirit of the reformer, and of the patriot.       Thank you, Fritz. And Happy Birthday.",,

In violation of the Constitution, US law, the Geneva      Conventions (to which the US is a signatory), and in      violation of basic human rights, torture has been authorized      by the President and his administration as official policy.      Water-boarding, beatings, faked executions, confinement in      extreme cold or extreme heat, prolonged enforcement of      painful stress positions, sleep deprivation, sexual      humiliation, and the defiling of religious articles have been      practiced and exposed as routine at Guantanamo, at Abu Ghraib      Prison and other US detention sites in Iraq, and at Bagram      Air Base in Afghanistan. The president, besides bearing      responsibility for authorizing the use of torture, also as      Commander in Chief, bears ultimate responsibility for the      failure to halt these practices and to punish those      responsible once they were exposed.       The administration has sought to claim the abuse of      captives is not torture, by redefining torture. An August 1,      2002 memorandum from the Administration's Office of Legal      Counsel Jay S. Bybee addressed to White House Counsel Alberto      R. Gonzales concluded that to constitute torture, any pain      inflicted must be akin to that accompanying ``serious      physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily      function, or even death.'' The memorandum went on to state      that even should an act constitute torture under that      minimal definition, it might still be permissible if      applied to ``interrogations undertaken pursuant to the      President's Commander-in-Chief powers.'' The memorandum      further asserted that ``necessity or self-defense could      provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal      liability.''       This effort to redefine torture by calling certain      practices simply ``enhanced interrogation techniques'' flies      in the face of the Third Geneva Convention Relating to the      Treatment of Prisoners of War, which states that ``No      physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion,      may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them      information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse      to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to any      unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.''       Torture is further prohibited by the Universal Declaration      of Human Rights, the paramount international human rights      statement adopted unanimously by the United Nations General      Assembly, including the United States, in 1948. Torture and      other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is      also prohibited by international treaties ratified by the      United States: the International Covenant on Civil and      Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention Against Torture      and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ",1,

Taguba      writes:       3. (U) Throughout the investigation, we observed many      individual soldiers and some subordinate units under the      800th Military Police Brigade that overcame significant      obstacles, persevered in extremely poor conditions, and      upheld Army Values. We discovered numerous examples of      soldiers and sailors taking the initiative in the absence of      leadership and accomplishing their assigned tasks.       a. (U) The 744th Military Police (MP) Battalion, commanded      by LTC Dennis McGlone, efficiently operated the HVD Detention      Facility at Camp Cropper and met mission requirements with      little to no guidance from the 800th, Military Police      Brigade. The unit was disciplined, proficient, and appeared      to understand their basic tasks.       b. (U) The 530th MP Battalion, commanded by LTC Stephen J.      Novotny, effectively maintained the MEK Detention Facility at      Camp Ashraf. His soldiers were proficient in their individual      tasks and adapted well to this highly unique and non-     doctrinal operation.       c. (U) The 165th Military Intelligence (MI) Battalion      excelled in providing perimeter security and force protection      at Abu Ghraib (BCCF). LTC Robert P. Walters, Jr., demanded      standards be enforced and worked endlessly to improve      discipline throughout the FOB.       4. (U) The individual soldiers and sailors that we observed      and believe should be favorably noted include:       a. (U) Master-at-Arms First Class William J. Kimbro, US      Navy Dog Handler, knew his duties and refused to participate      in improper interrogations despite significant pressure from      the MI personnel at Abu Ghraib.       b. (U) SPC Joseph M. Darby, 372nd MP Company discovered      evidence of abuse and turned it over to military law      enforcement.       c. (U) 1LT David O. Sutton, 229th MP Company, took      immediate action and stopped an abuse, then reported the      incident to the chain of command.       By this letter we express our admiration and appreciation      for the courageous and decent execution of military duties by      these individuals and units, as we admire and appreciate the      work of MG Taguba and his staff and assistants.       It is painfully and visibly evident that there have been      abuses and violations of legal, Christian, and humane      standards of conduct. We are shamed by the facts, and we know      only too well how long the world's memory is likely to be. In      the midst of the darkness, however, we take particular      comfort from knowing that in spite of the pressures and in      spite of the many bad examples, and perhaps even bad orders,      there were men and women whose deeds may inspire us all to      live up to all that is noble and right.       We share with all people of faith, and especially with      other Christians, Jews, and Muslims, many understandings of      what divine direction and purpose call us to do and be. In      our own language, ``The light shines in the darkness, and the      darkness did not overcome it. (John 1:4, NRSV)'' We are      grateful that God has called men and women in even the most      difficult of circumstances to respect the dignity and      intrinsic worth of others.       We ask you to reflect our tribute in an official way, by      reference or quotation in the Congressional Record perhaps.      If there is a way for Congress to honor the units and      individuals who have distinguished themselves      and preserved honor for all of us, we ask you to support it      or lead it energetically.           Sincerely yours,     Rev. Nancy Holmes Nyberg,                                                           Pastor.

   AND COMMERCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006--Continued",,,"Let me begin with a simple sentence that, even as I write      it, appears less than Swiftian in the modesty of its      proposal: ``Prison conditions at Abu Ghraib have improved      markedly and dramatically since the arrival of Coalition      troops in Baghdad.''       I could undertake to defend that statement against any      member of Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International, and I      know in advance that none of them could challenge it, let      alone negate it. Before March 2003, Abu Ghraib was an      abattoir, a torture chamber, and a concentration camp. Now,      and not without reason, it is an international byword for      Yankee imperialism and sadism. Yet the improvement is still,      unarguably, the difference between night and day. How is it      possible that the advocates of a post Saddam Iraq have been      placed on the defensive in this manner? And where should one      begin?       I once tried to calculate how long the post-Cold War      liberal Utopia had actually lasted. Whether you chose to date      its inception from the fall of the Berlin Wall in November      1989, or the death of Nicolae Ceausescu in late December of      the same year, or the release of Nelson Mandela from prison,      or the referendum defeat suffered by Augusto Pinochet (or      indeed from the publication of Francis Fukuyama's book about      the ``end of history'' and the unarguable triumph of market      liberal pluralism), it was an epoch that in retrospect was      over before it began. By the middle of 1990, Saddam Hussein      had abolished Kuwait and Slobodan Milosevic was attempting to      erase the identity and the existence of Bosnia. It turned out      that we had not by any means escaped the reach of atavistic,      aggressive, expansionist, and totalitarian ideology. Proving      the same point in another way, and within approximately the      same period, the theocratic dictator of Iran had publicly      claimed the right to offer money in his own name for the      suborning of the murder of a novelist living in London, and      the genocidaire faction in Rwanda had decided that it could      probably get away with putting its long-fantasized plan of      mass murder into operation.       One is not mentioning these apparently discrepant crimes      and nightmares as a random or unsorted list.       Khomeini, for example, was attempting to compensate for the      humiliation of the peace agreement he had been compelled to      sign with Saddam Hussein. And Saddam Hussein needed to make      up the loss, of prestige and income, that he had himself      suffered in the very same war. Milosevic (anticipating Putin,      as it now seems to me, and perhaps Beijing also) was riding a      mutation of socialist nationalism into national socialism. It      was to be noticed in all cases that the aggressors, whether      they were killing Muslims, or exalting Islam, or just killing      their neighbors, shared a deep and abiding hatred of the      United States.       The balance sheet of the Iraq war, if it is to be seriously      drawn up, must also involve a confrontation with at least      this much of recent history. Was the Bush administration      right to leave--actually to confirm--Saddam Hussein in power      after his eviction from Kuwait in 1991? Was James Baker      correct to say, in his delightfully folksy manner, that the      United States did not ``have a dog in the fight'' that      involved ethnic cleansing for the mad dream of a Greater      Serbia? Was the Clinton administration prudent in its retreat      from Somalia, or wise in its opposition to the U.N.      resolution that called for a preemptive strengthening of the      U.N. forces in Rwanda?       I know hardly anybody who comes out of this examination      with complete credit. There were neoconservatives who jeered      at Rushdie in 1989 and who couldn't see the point when      Sarajevo faced obliteration in 1992. There were leftist      humanitarians and radicals who rallied to Rushdie and called      for solidarity with Bosnia, but who--perhaps because of a bad      conscience about Palestine--couldn't face a confrontation      with Saddam Hussein even when he annexed a neighbor state      that was a full member of the Arab League and of the U.N. (I      suppose I have to admit that I was for a time a member of      that second group.) But there were consistencies, too. French      statecraft, for example, was uniformly hostile to any      resistance to any aggression, and Paris even sent troops to      rescue its filthy clientele in Rwanda. And some on the hard      left and the brute right were also opposed to any exercise,      for any reason, of American military force.       The only speech by any statesman that can bear reprinting      from that low, dishonest decade came from Tony Blair when he      spoke in Chicago in 1999. Welcoming the defeat and overthrow      of Milosevic after the Kosovo intervention, he warned against      any self-satisfaction and drew attention to an inescapable      confrontation that was coming with Saddam Hussein. So far      from being an American ``poodle,'' as his taunting and      ignorant foes like to sneer, Blair had in fact leaned on      Clinton over Kosovo and was insisting on the importance of      Iraq while George Bush was still an isolationist governor of      Texas.       Notwithstanding this prescience and principle on his part,      one still cannot read the journals of the 2000/2001      millennium without the feeling that one is revisiting a      hopelessly somnambulist relative in a neglected home. I am      one of those who believe, uncynically, that Osama bin Laden      did us all a service (and holy war a great disservice) by his      mad decision to assault the American homeland four years ago.      Had he not made this world-historical mistake, we would have      been able to add a Talibanized and nuclear-armed Pakistan to      our list of the threats we failed to recognize in time. (This      threat still exists, but it is no longer so casually      overlooked.)       The subsequent liberation of Pakistan's theocratic colony      in Afghanistan, and the so-far decisive eviction and defeat      of its bin Ladenist guests, was only a reprisal. It took care      of the last attack. But what about the next one? For anyone      with eyes to see, there was only one other state that      combined the latent and the blatant definitions of both      ``rogue'' and ``failed.'' This state--Saddam's ruined and      tortured and collapsing Iraq--had also met all the conditions      under which a country may be deemed to have sacrificed its      own legal sovereignty. To recapitulate: It had invaded its      neighbors, committed genocide on its own soil, harbored and      nurtured international thugs and killers, and flouted      every provision of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The      United Nations, in this crisis, faced with regular insult      to its own resolutions and its own character, had managed      to set up a system of sanctions-based mutual corruption.      In May 2003, had things gone on as they had been going,      Saddam Hussein would have been due to fill Iraq's slot as      chair of the U.N. Conference on Disarmament. Meanwhile,      every species of gangster from the hero of the Achille      Lauro hijacking to Abu Musab al Zarqawi was finding      hospitality under Saddam's crumbling roof.       One might have thought, therefore, that Bush and Blair's      decision to put an end at last to this intolerable state of      affairs would be hailed, not just as a belated vindication of      long-ignored U.N. resolutions but as some corrective to the      decade of shame and inaction that had just passed in Bosnia      and Rwanda. But such is not the case. An apparent consensus      exists, among millions of people in Europe and America, that      the whole operation for the demilitarization of Iraq, and the      salvage of its traumatized society, was at best a false      pretense and at worst an unprovoked aggression. How can this      possibly be?       There is, first, the problem of humorless and pseudo-     legalistic literalism. In Saki's short story The Lumber Room,      the naughty but clever child Nicholas, who has actually      placed a frog in his morning bread-and-milk, rejoices in his      triumph over the adults who don't credit this excuse for not      eating his healthful dish:       ``You said there couldn't possibly be a frog in my bread-     and-milk; there was a frog in my bread-and-milk,'' he      repeated, with the insistence of a skilled tactician who does      not intend to shift from favorable ground.       Childishness is one thing--those of us who grew up on this      wonderful Edwardian author were always happy to see the      grown-ups and governesses discomfited. But puerility in      adults is quite another thing, and considerably less      charming. ``You said there were WMDs in Iraq and that Saddam      had friends in al Qaeda. . . . Blah, blah, pants on fire.'' I      have had many opportunities to tire of this mantra. It takes      ten seconds to intone the said mantra. It would take me, on      my most eloquent C-SPAN day, at the very least five minutes      to say that Abdul Rahman Yasin, who mixed the chemicals for      the World Trade Center attack in 1993, subsequently sought      and found refuge in Baghdad; that Dr. Mahdi Obeidi, Saddam's      senior physicist, was able to lead American soldiers to      nuclear centrifuge parts and a blueprint for a complete      centrifuge (the crown jewel of nuclear physics) buried on the      orders of Qusay Hussein; that Saddam's agents were in      Damascus as late as February 2003, negotiating to purchase      missiles off the shelf from North Korea; or that Rolf Ekeus,      the great Swedish socialist who founded the inspection      process in Iraq after 1991, has told me for the record that      he was offered a $2 million bribe in a face-to face meeting      with Tariq Aziz. And these eye-catching examples would by no      means exhaust my repertoire, or empty my quiver. Yes, it must      be admitted that Bush and Blair made a hash of a good case,      largely because they preferred to scare people rather      than enlighten them or reason with them. Still, the only real      strategy of deception has come from those who believe, or      pretend, that Saddam Hussein was no problem.       I have a ready answer to those who accuse me of being an      agent and tool of the Bush-Cheney administration (which is      the nicest thing that my enemies can find to say). Attempting      a little levity, I respond that I could stay at home if the      authorities could bother to make their own case, but that I      meanwhile am a prisoner of what I actually do know about the      permanent hell, and the permanent threat, of the Saddam      regime. However, having debated almost all of the      spokespeople for the antiwar faction, both the sane and the      deranged, I was recently asked a question that I was      temporarily unable to answer. ``If what you claim is true,''      the honest citizen at this meeting politely asked me,      ``how come the White House hasn't told us?''       I do in fact know the answer to this question. So deep and      bitter is the split within official Washington, most      especially between the Defense Department and the CIA, that      any claim made by the former has been undermined by leaks      from the latter. (The latter being those who maintained, with      a combination of dogmatism and cowardice not seen since      Lincoln had to fire General McClellan, that Saddam Hussein      was both a ``secular'' actor and--this is the really rich      bit--a rational and calculating one.)       There's no cure for that illusion, but the resulting      bureaucratic chaos and unease has cornered the president into      his current fallback upon platitude and hollowness. It has      also induced him to give hostages to fortune. The claim that      if we fight fundamentalism ``over there'' we won't have to      confront it ``over here'' is not just a standing invitation      for disproof by the next suicide-maniac in London or Chicago,      but a coded appeal to provincial and isolationist opinion in      the United States. Surely the elementary lesson of the grim      anniversary that will shortly be upon us is that American      civilians are as near to the front line as American soldiers.       It is exactly this point that makes nonsense of the sob-     sister tripe pumped out by the Cindy Sheehan circus and its      surrogates. But in reply, why bother to call a struggle      ``global'' if you then try to localize it? Just say plainly      that we shall fight them everywhere they show themselves, and      fight them on principle as well as in practice, and get ready      to warn people that Nigeria is very probably the next target      of the jihadists. The peaceniks love to ask: When and where      will it all end? The answer is easy: It will end with the      surrender or defeat of one of the contending parties. Should      I add that I am certain which party that ought to be? Defeat      is just about imaginable, though the mathematics and the      algebra tell heavily against the holy warriors. Surrender to      such a foe, after only four years of combat, is not even      worthy of consideration.       Antaeus was able to draw strength from the earth every time      an antagonist wrestled him to the ground. A reverse mythology      has been permitted to take hold in the present case, where      bad news is deemed to be bad news only for regime-change.      Anyone with the smallest knowledge of Iraq knows that its      society and infrastructure and institutions have been      appallingly maimed and beggared by three decades of war and      fascism (and the ``divide-and-rule'' tactics by which Saddam      maintained his own tribal minority of the Sunni minority in      power). In logic and morality, one must therefore compare the      current state of the country with the likely or probable      state of it had Saddam and his sons been allowed to go on      ruling.       At once, one sees that all the alternatives would have been      infinitely worse, and would most likely have led to an      implosion--as well as opportunistic invasions from Iran and      Turkey and Saudi Arabia, on behalf of their respective      interests or confessional clienteles. This would in turn have      necessitated a more costly and bloody intervention by some      kind of coalition, much too late and on even worse terms and      conditions. This is the lesson of Bosnia and Rwanda      yesterday, and of Darfur today. When I have made this point      in public, I have never had anyone offer an answer to it. A      broken Iraq was in our future no matter what, and was a      responsibility (somewhat conditioned by our past blunders)      that no decent person could shirk. The only unthinkable      policy was one of abstention.       Two pieces of good fortune still attend those of us who go      out on the road for this urgent and worthy cause. The first      is contingent: There are an astounding number of plain frauds      and charlatans (to phrase it at is highest) in charge of the      propaganda of the other side. Just to tell off the names is      to frighten children more than Saki ever could: Michael      Moore, George Galloway, Jacques Chirac, Tim Robbins, Richard      Clarke, Joseph Wilson . . . a roster of gargoyles that      would send Ripley himself into early retirement. Some of      these characters are flippant, and make heavy jokes about      Halliburton, and some disdain to conceal their sympathy      for the opposite side. So that's easy enough.       The second bit of luck is a certain fiber displayed by a      huge number of anonymous Americans. Faced with a constant      drizzle of bad news and purposely demoralizing commentary,      millions of people stick out their jaws and hang tight. I am      no fan of populism, but I surmise that these citizens are      clear on the main point: It is out of the question--plainly      and absolutely out of the question--that we should surrender      the keystone state of the Middle East to a rotten, murderous      alliance between Baathists and bin Ladenists. When they hear      the fatuous insinuation that this alliance has only been      created by the resistance to it, voters know in their      intestines that those who say so are soft on crime and soft      on fascism. The more temperate anti-warriors, such as Mark      Danner and Harold Meyerson, like to employ the term ``a war      of choice.'' One should have no problem in accepting this      concept. As they cannot and do not deny, there was going to      be another round with Saddam Hussein no matter what. To whom,      then, should the ``choice'' of time and place have fallen?      The clear implication of the antichoice faction--if I may so      dub them--is that this decision should have been left up to      Saddam Hussein. As so often before.       Does the President deserve the benefit of the reserve of      fortitude that I just mentioned? Only just, if at all. We      need not argue about the failures and the mistakes and even      the crimes, because these in some ways argue themselves. But      a positive accounting could be offered without braggartry,      and would include:       (1) The overthrow of Talibanism and Baathism, and the      exposure of many highly suggestive links between the two      elements of this Hitler-Stalin pact. Abu Musab al Zarqawi,      who moved from Afghanistan to Iraq before the coalition      intervention, has even gone to the trouble of naming his      organization al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.       (2) The subsequent capitulation of Qaddafi's Libya in point      of weapons of mass destruction--a capitulation that was      offered not to Kofi Annan or the E.U. but to Blair and Bush.       (3) The consequent unmasking of the A.Q. Khan network for      the illicit transfer of nuclear technology to Libya, Iran,      and North Korea.       (4) The agreement by the United Nations that its own reform      is necessary and overdue, and the unmasking of a quasi-     criminal network within its elite.       (5) The craven admission by President Chirac and Chancellor      Schroder, when confronted with irrefutable evidence of      cheating and concealment, respecting solemn treaties, on the      part of Iran, that not even this will alter their commitment      to neutralism. (One had already suspected as much in the      Iraqi case. )       (6) The ability to certify Iraq as actually disarmed,      rather than accept the word of a psychopathic autocrat.       (7) The immense gains made by the largest stateless      minority in the region--the Kurds--and the spread of this      example to other states.       (8) The related encouragement of democratic and civil      society movements in Egypt, Syria, and most notably Lebanon,      which has regained a version of its autonomy.       (9) The violent and ignominious death of thousands of bin      Ladenist infiltrators into Iraq and Afghanistan, and the real      prospect of greatly enlarging this number.       (10) The training and hardening of many thousands of      American servicemen and women in a battle against the forces      of nihilism and absolutism, which training and hardening will      surely be of great use in future combat.       It would be admirable if the president could manage to make      such a presentation. It would also be welcome if he and his      deputies adopted a clear attitude toward the war within the      war: in other words, stated plainly, that the secular and      pluralist forces within Afghan and Iraqi society, while they      are not our clients, can in no circumstance be allowed to      wonder which outcome we favor.       The great point about Blair's 1999 speech was that it      asserted the obvious. Coexistence with aggressive regimes or      expansionist, theocratic, and totalitarian ideologies is not      in fact possible. One should welcome this conclusion for the      additional reason that such coexistence is not desirable,      either. If the great effort to remake Iraq as a demilitarized      federal and secular democracy should fail or be defeated, I      shall lose sleep for the rest of my life in reproaching      myself for doing too little. But at least I shall have the      comfort of not having offered, so far as I can recall, any      word or deed that contributed to a defeat.",,

                    IN UNITED STATES CUSTODY IN IRAQ",WASHINGTON,2.370665278683354,"It's an image that would do Saddam proud. A terrified      prisoner, hooded and dressed in rags, his hands out-stretched      on either side of him, electrodes attached to his fingers and      genitals. He's been forced to stand on a box about one-foot      square. His captors have told him that, if he falls off the      box, he'll be electrocuted.       The torture victim was an Iraqi and his torturers were      American soldiers. The picture captures the moment when      members of the coalition forces, who styled themselves      liberators, were exposed as torturers. The image of the wired      and hooded Iraqi was one of a series of photographs, leaked      by a horrified U.S. soldier inside Saddam's old punishment      centre, Abu Ghraib--now a U.S. POW camp.       When the images were flashed around the world by America's      CBS television network last Wednesday, there was a smug      feeling within the U.K. that British troops would never      behave like that to their prisoners. But on Friday night, the      U.K. was treated to images--courtesy of the Daily Mirror--of      British soldiers urinating on a blood-stained Iraqi captive,      holding guns against the man's head, stamping on his face,      kicking him in the mouth and beating him in the groin with a      rifle butt.       The pictures of U.S. soldiers torturing their captives have      the added horror of sexual abuse. In five of the 14 images      that the Sunday Herald has seen, a female soldier--identified      as Lynndie England, a 21-year-old from a West Virginia      trailer park--is playing up to the camera while her captives      are tortured. In one picture, she's smiling and giving the      thumbs-up. Her hand rests on the buttocks of a naked and      hooded Iraqi who has been forced to sit on the shoulders of      another Iraqi prisoner.       In another, she is sprawled laughing over a pyramid of      naked Iraqis. A male colleague stands behind her grinning.      Later, she's got a cigarette clenched between grinning lips      and is pointing at the genitals of a line of naked, hooded      Iraqis. A third snap shows her embracing a colleague as a      naked Iraqi lies before them.       In other pictures, two naked Iraqis are forced to simulate      oral sex and a group of naked men are made to clamber on to      each other's backs. One dreadful picture features nothing but      the bloated face of an Iraqi who has been beaten to death.      His body is wrapped in plastic.       Other pictures, which the world has not seen, but which are      in the hands of the U.S. military, include shots of a dog      attacking a prisoner. An accused soldier says dogs are ``used      for intimidation factors''.       There are also pictures of an apparent male rape. An Iraqi      POW claims that a civilian translator, hired to work in the      prison, raped a male juvenile prisoner. He said: ``They      covered all the doors with sheets. I heard the screaming . .      . and the female soldier was taking pictures.''       The British pictures show a hooded Iraqi aged between 18-20      on the floor of a military truck being brutalized. According      to two squaddies who took part in the torture, but later blew      the whistle, the Iraqi's ordeal lasted eight hours and he was      left with a broken jaw and missing teeth. He was bleeding and      vomited when his captors threw him out of a speeding truck.      No one knows if he lived or died.       One of the British soldiers said: ``Basically this guy was      dying as he couldn't take any more. An officer came down. It      was `Get rid of him--I haven't seen him'.'' The other      whistle-blower said he had witnessed a prisoner being beaten      senseless by troops. ``You could hear your mate's boots      hitting this lad's spine . . . One of the lads broke his      wrist off a prisoner's head. Another nearly broke his foot      kicking him.''       According to the British soldiers, the military police have      found a video of prisoners being thrown from a bridge, and a      prisoner was allegedly beaten to death in custody by men from      the Queen's Lancashire Regiment. Although there is a debate      about the veracity of the images, Armed Forces Minister Adam      Ingram said that if the pictures were real, they were      ``appalling''. A Downing Street spokesman said Tony Blair      expected ``the highest standards of conduct from our forces      in Iraq''. The U.K.'s most senior army officer, General Mike      Jackson, said that if the allegations were true then those      involved were ``not fit to wear the Queen's uniform.'' The      Defense Ministry is in crisis over the pictures as top      brass know they ruin any hope of U.K. forces winning Iraqi      hearts and minds.       The U.S. torture pictures were taken by members of the      American 800th Military Police Brigade sometime late last      year. Following an investigation, 17 soldiers were removed      from duty for mistreating captives. Six face court martial.      Brigadier General Janice Karpinski, who ran Abu Ghraib and      three other U.S. military jails, is suspended and faces court      martial. Prior to the relevations, Karpinski assured the U.S.      media that Abu Ghraib was run according to ``international      standards''.       Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, deputy director of      coalition operations in Iraq, said he was ``appalled''. He      added: ``These are our fellow soldiers. They were the same      uniform as us, and they let their fellow soldiers down. Our      soldiers could be taken prisoner as well--and we expect our      soldiers to be treated well by the adversary, by the enemy--     and if we can't hold ourselves up as an example of how to      treat people with dignity and respect . . . we can't ask that      other nations do that to our soldiers as well. This is wrong.      This is reprehensible. But this is not representative of the      150,000 soldiers over here.''       But these soldiers aren't simply mavericks. Some accused      claim they acted on the orders of military intelligence and      the CIA, and that some of the torture sessions were under the      control of mercenaries hired by the U.S. to conduct      interrogations. Two ``civilian contract'' organizations      taking part in interrogations at Abu Ghraib are linked to the      Bush administration.       California-based Titan Corporation says it is ``a leading      provider of solutions for services for national security''.      Between 2003-04, it gave nearly $40,000 to George W. Bush's      Republican Party. Titan supplied translators to the military.       CACI International Inc. describes its aim as helping      ``America's intelligence community in the war on terrorism''.      Richard Armitage, the current deputy U.S. secretary of state,      sat on CACI's board.       No civilians, however, are facing charges as military law      does not apply to them. Colonel Jill Morgenthaler, from      CentCom, said that one civilian contractor was accused along      with six soldiers of mistreating prisoners. However, it was      left to the contractor to ``deal with him''. One civilian      interrogator told army investigators that he had      ``unintentionally'' broken several tables during      interrogations as he was trying to ``fear-up'' detainees.       Lawyers for some accused say their clients are scapegoats      for a rogue prison system, which allowed mercenaries to give      orders to serving soldiers. A military report said private      contractors were at times supervising the interrogations.       Kimmitt said: ``I hope the investigation is including not      only the people who committed the crimes, but some of the      people who might have encouraged the crimes as well because      they certainly share some responsibility.''       Last night, CACI vice-president Jody Brown said: ``The      company supports the Army's investigation and acknowledges      that CACI personnel in Iraq volunteered to be interviewed by      army officials in connection with the investigation. The      company has received no indication that any CACI employee was      involved in any alleged improper conduct with Iraqi      prisoners. Nonetheless, CACI has initiated an independent      investigation.''       However, military investigators said: ``A CACI      investigator's contract was terminated because he allowed      and/or instructed military police officers who were not      trained in interrogation techniques to facilitate      interrogations which were neither authorised nor in      accordance with regulations.''       One of the U.S. soldiers facing court martial is reservist      Staff Sergeant Chip Frederick--the equivalent of a part-time      territorial army squaddie. In civvy street, he was a prison      warder in Virginia. Frederick has said he will plead not      guilty and blame the army for the torture at Abu Ghraib. ``We      had no support, no training whatsoever,'' he said, claiming      he had never been shown the Geneva Convention. ``I kept      asking my chain of command for certain things like rules and      regulations and it just wasn't happening.''       Frederick also blamed the intelligence services for      encouraging the brutality.   ",1,

He refused to give detainees the protections of the Geneva Conventions, calling them ``quaint.'' He facilitated the establishment of Guantanamo and denied other basic legal protections to detainees. He approved an interpretation of the law that was inconsistent with international agreements. He authorized the use of torture, a step that led to the horrors of Abu Ghraib. At every turn, he promoted an extreme view of the President's authority.

The secret facility is part of a covert prison system set      up by the CIA nearly four years ago that at various times has      included sites in eight countries, including Thailand,      Afghanistan and several democracies in Eastern Europe, as      well as a small center at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba,      according to current and former intelligence officials and      diplomats from three continents.       The hidden global internment network is a central element      in the CIA's unconventional war on terrorism. It depends on      the cooperation of foreign intelligence services, and on      keeping even basic information about the system secret from      the public, foreign officials and nearly all members of      Congress charged with overseeing the CIA's covert actions.       The existence and locations of the facilities--referred to      as ``black sites'' in classified White House, CIA, Justice      Department and congressional documents--are known to only a      handful of officials in the United States and, usually, only      to the president and a few top intelligence officers in each      host country.       The CIA and the White House, citing national security      concerns and the value of the program, have dissuaded      Congress from demanding that the agency answer questions in      open testimony about the conditions under which captives are      held. Virtually nothing is known about who is kept in the      facilities, what interrogation methods are employed with      them, or how decisions are made about whether they should be      detained or for how long.       While the Defense Department has produced volumes of public      reports and testimony about its detention practices and rules      after the abuse scandals at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison and at      Guantanamo Bay, the CIA has not even acknowledged the      existence of its black sites. To do so, say officials      familiar with the program, could open the U.S. government to      legal challenges, particularly in foreign courts, and      increase the risk of political condemnation at home and      abroad.       But the revelations of widespread prisoner abuse in      Afghanistan and Iraq by the U.S. military--which operates      under published rules and transparent oversight of Congress--     have increased concern among lawmakers, foreign governments      and human rights groups about the opaque CIA system. Those      concerns escalated last month, when Vice President Cheney and      CIA Director Porter J. Goss asked Congress to exempt CIA      employees from legislation already endorsed by 90 senators      that would bar cruel and degrading treatment of any prisoner      in U.S. custody.       Although the CIA will not acknowledge details of its      system, intelligence officials defend the agency's approach,      arguing that the successful defense of the country requires      that the agency be empowered to hold and interrogate      suspected terrorists for as long as necessary and without      restrictions imposed by the U.S. legal system or even by the      military tribunals established for prisoners held at      Guantanamo Bay.       The Washington Post is not publishing the names of the      Eastern European countries involved in the covert program, at      the request of senior U.S. officials. They argued that the      disclosure might disrupt counterterrorism efforts in those      countries and elsewhere and could make them targets of      possible terrorist retaliation.       The secret detention system was conceived in the chaotic      and anxious first months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks,      when the working assumption was that a second strike was      imminent.       Since then, the arrangement has been increasingly debated      within the CIA, where considerable concern lingers about the      legality, morality and practicality of holding even      unrepentant terrorists in such isolation and secrecy, perhaps      for the duration of their lives. Mid-level and senior CIA      officers began arguing two years ago that the system was      unsustainable and diverted the agency from its unique      espionage mission.       ``We never sat down, as far as I know, and came up with a      grand strategy,'' said one former senior intelligence officer      who is familiar with the program but not the location of the      prisons. ``Everything was very reactive. That's how you get      to a situation where you pick people up, send them into a      netherworld and don't say, `What are we going to do with them      afterwards?' ''       It is illegal for the government to hold prisoners in such      isolation in secret prisons in the United States, which is      why the CIA placed them overseas, according to several former      and current intelligence officials and other U.S. government      officials. Legal experts and intelligence officials said that      the CIA's internment practices also would be considered      illegal under the laws of several host countries, where      detainees have rights to have a lawyer or to mount a defense      against allegations of wrongdoing.        Host countries have signed the U.N. Convention Against      Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or      Punishment, as has the United States. Yet CIA interrogators      in the overseas sites are permitted to use the CIA's approved      ``Enhanced Interrogation Techniques,'' some of which are      prohibited by the U.N. convention and by U.S. military law.      They include tactics such as ``waterboarding,'' in which a      prisoner is made to believe he or she is drowning.       Some detainees apprehended by the CIA and transferred to      foreign intelligence agencies have alleged after their      release that they were tortured, although it is unclear      whether CIA personnel played a role in the alleged abuse.      Given the secrecy surrounding CIA detentions, such      accusations have heightened concerns among foreign      governments and human rights groups about CIA detention and      interrogation practices.       The contours of the CIA's detention program have emerged in      bits and pieces over the past two years. Parliaments in      Canada, Italy, France, Sweden and the Netherlands have opened      inquiries into alleged CIA operations that secretly captured      their citizens or legal residents and transferred them to the      agency's prisons.       More than 100 suspected terrorists have been sent by the      CIA into the covert system, according to current and former      U.S. intelligence officials and foreign sources. This figure,      a rough estimate based on information from sources who said      their knowledge of the numbers was incomplete, does not      include prisoners picked up in Iraq.       The detainees break down roughly into two classes, the      sources said.       About 30 are considered major terrorism suspects and have      been held under the highest level of secrecy at black sites      financed by the CIA and managed by agency personnel,      including those in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, according to      current and former intelligence officers and two other U.S.      government officials. Two locations in this category--in      Thailand and on the grounds of the military prison at      Guantanamo Bay--were closed in 2003 and 2004, respectively.       A second tier--which these sources believe includes more      than 70 detainees--is a group considered less important, with      less direct involvement in terrorism and having limited      intelligence value. These prisoners, some of whom were      originally taken to black sites, are delivered to      intelligence services in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Afghanistan      and other countries, a process sometimes known as      ``rendition.'' While the first-tier black sites are run by      CIA officers, the jails in these countries are operated by      the host nations, with CIA financial assistance and,      sometimes, direction.       Morocco, Egypt and Jordan have said that they do not      torture detainees, although years of State Department human      rights reports accuse all three of chronic prisoner abuse.       The top 30 al Qaeda prisoners exist in complete isolation      from the outside world. Kept in dark, sometimes underground      cells, they have no recognized legal rights, and no one      outside the CIA is allowed to talk with or even see them, or      to otherwise verify their well-being, said current and former      and U.S. and foreign government and intelligence officials.       Most of the facilities were built and are maintained with      congressionally appropriated funds, but the White House has      refused to allow the CIA to brief anyone except the House and      Senate intelligence committees' chairmen and vice chairmen on      the program's generalities.       The Eastern European countries that the CIA has persuaded      to hide al Qaeda captives are democracies that have embraced      the rule of law and individual rights after decades of Soviet      domination. Each has been trying to cleanse its intelligence      services of operatives who have worked on behalf of others--     mainly Russia and organized crime.",1,

Nineteen men armed      only with box cutters hijacked four passenger airliners and      rammed three of them into the symbols of American military      and financial might. Two of the planes flew into the twin      towers of the World Trade Center in New York in a horrifying      spectacle. A third plane demolished a wing of the Pentagon. A      fourth, United Flight 93, believed to be headed for      Washington, crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after      passengers rose up against the hijackers, In less than an      hour, 3,000 people died that day.

President Bush said last week that scores      of terrorist plots have been foiled, and that while America      is safer than it was five years ago, it is still not safe.      Will it ever be in a world of suicidal maniacs?       On this anniversary, we would do well to put aside our      rancorous divisions and crazy conspiracy theories and reflect      on that post-9/11 period when Americans came together in      purpose and spirit and much of the world felt our pain, even      if it all was too brief. That memory is worth holding on to.       There was something unreal about watching the horror of      that day unfold on television. Who can forget the sight of      people leaping to their deaths from the top floors of the      burning twin towers? Or of the first responders--     firefighters, police officers and rescue workers--who      heroically braved smoke and fire and dust in their desperate      attempt to reach any survivors? Americans lined up to donate      blood and gave generously      to aid the families of the victims. We knew the endless      kindness of strangers. In Washington, bitter partisanship      gave way to unity and the debate over domestic priorities was      crushed by the question of how to protect the homeland from      madmen bent on mass destruction.       The world wept with us and for us as they saw America as a      victim instead of an arrogant superpower. Iranians held      candlelight vigils to express support for the American      people. Germans marched in the street to show solidarity. In      France, a front-page editorial in Le Monde, reliably anti-     American on most things, proclaimed: ``We Are All      Americans.'' The world stayed with us when Bush launched a      ``just war'' in Afghanistan, where the Taliban was protecting      Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida terrorists.       Sadly, the good that came out of 9/11 was not to last. It      began to unravel after the president, with the approval of      most congressional Democrats, chose to go to war against      Iraq, which had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. World      opinion turned against us, and as Iraq became a huge debacle,      Americans turned on each other.       America has taken quite a beating in world opinion in      recent years on everything from prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib      and Guantanamo to secret CIA prisons abroad and warrantless      eavesdropping at home. The debate over balancing our      liberties and our security rages on in Washington, and      America's image in the world has been badly tarnished.       We can never go back to the way things were before 9/11--or      even to the way we were in the immediate aftermath of that      calamity. It's hard to imagine a future not chilled by the      threat of terrorism, which started as a cause and has now      metastasized into a mentality among Islamic extremists.       But we can--and we must--hold on to the values and the      spirit that some call American exceptionalism. The terrorists      would like nothing better than to see us surrender our most      precious freedoms and bedrock values to fear.       So on this fifth anniversary of that day of unspeakable      savagery, let us remember how we felt on Sept. 12, 2001, not      the fear and heartbreak so much as the unity and purpose we      shared. Only then can we take a full measure of our loss.",,

It came to an official close on Thursday      with an appropriately subdued ceremony in Baghdad. We mourn      the nearly 4,500 American troops and tens of thousands of      Iraqis who lost their lives.       After so much pain and sacrifice, Iraqis now have the      responsibility for making their own better future. The      fighting is not over, and success is still a long shot. The      United States has a major role to play: encouraging,      supporting and goading Iraq's leaders to make the long-     delayed political compromises that are their only hope for      building a stable democracy.       The fact that Saddam Hussein is gone is a genuine cause for      celebration. But the list of errors and horrors in this war      is inexcusably long, starting with a rush to invasion based      on manipulated intelligence.       The Bush administration had no plan for governing the      country once Saddam was deposed. The Iraqi economy still      bears the scars from the first frenzied days of looting. The      decision to disband the Sunni-dominated Iraqi Army helped      unleash five years of sectarian strife that has not fully      abated. Iraq's political system remains deeply riven by      ethnic and religious differences.       America's reputation has yet to fully recover from the      horrors of Abu Ghraib. The country is still paying a huge      price for President George W. Bush's decision to shortchange      the war in Afghanistan. American policy makers, for      generations to come, must study these mistakes carefully and      ensure that they are not repeated.       As for Iraq today, the authoritarian tendencies of Prime      Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki are deeply troubling. A member      of the Shiite majority that was badly persecuted under      Saddam, he has been far more interested in payback than      inclusion.       Washington has pushed him over the years--but, often, not      hard enough.       The Baghdad government promised jobs to 100,000 members of      the Sunni Awakening movement--insurgents whose decision to      switch sides helped end the civil war--but only half that      have been hired. Parliament still needs to enact a law,      called for in the Constitution, that would provide a legal      basis for determining who should be prosecuted for supporting      Saddam's Baath Party or other extremist ideologies. Iraq's      leaders have many more issues to resolve. Incredibly, they      have still not decided how to divide the country's oil      wealth. There is no agreement on who will control the oil-     rich city of Kirkuk, which is claimed by both Baghdad and the      semiautonomous Kurdish regional government.       Iraq's oil production still has not rebounded, and basic      services like electricity are still woefully inadequate. Iraq      needs an impartial justice system. Washington has pressed      Baghdad for years to end corruption and build a      representative government. It will need to keep pressing.       After investing billions of dollars, the United States has      had more success rebuilding Iraq's security forces. But Iraqi      and American commanders say these forces are not ready to      fully protect the country against insurgents or potentially      hostile neighbors. There are critical weaknesses in      intelligence, air defenses, artillery and logistics.       The Obama administration was unable to reach a new defense      agreement with Baghdad that would have allowed several      thousand American troops to stay behind as backup. We hope      that the Iraqi Army will do better than expected. The      administration must be prepared to offer limited help if the      army does get into serious trouble.       President Obama, who first ran for office campaigning      against the war, has never wavered on his promise to bring      the troops home. The last few thousand will be out of Iraq by      year's end. We celebrate their return. But this country must      never forget the intolerable costs of a war started on      arrogance and lies.",1,

U.S. Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld approved the use of      ``harsh'' interrogation techniques at Guantanamo Bay,      including stripping detainees naked, making them hold      ``stress'' positions and depriving them of sleep, a Pentagon      official has confirmed.       Stephen Cambone, the under-secretary of defence for      intelligence, also said severe interrogation techniques,      including the use of dogs to intimidate prisoners, had been      approved by military commanders in Iraq.       But Mr. Cambone, Mr. Rumsfeld's top intelligence official,      insisted that all U.S. soldiers in Iraq were under orders to      obey the Geneva Convention. He denied that the U.S. military      leadership had helped create a climate for prison abuse.        Mr. Cambone was speaking at a Senate hearing to investigate      the torture scandal at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad, and to      determine whether the seven low-ranking guards facing courts      martial for physical and sexual abuse of prisoners were      following orders.       Revealing the interrogation methods allowed in Iraq, the      Senate Armed Services Committee released a single page titled      ``Interrogation Rules of Engagement'', listing two categories      of measures.       The first showed basic techniques approved for all      detainees, while the second involved tougher measures that      required approval by Lieutenant-General Ricardo Sanchez,      commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. Among the items on the      second list were stress positions for up to 45 minutes, sleep      deprivation for up to 72 hours and use of muzzled dogs.       Mr. Cambone said the Bush Administration's policy has been      to apply the Geneva Convention to the interrogation and other      treatment of detainees in Iraq, but several senators      expressed doubts about whether some of the listed techniques      conformed with international limits.       Major-General Antonio Taguba, who wrote a damning army      report on abuse at Abu Ghraib, told the committee he found no      evidence ``of a policy or a direct order given to these      soldiers to conduct what they did''.       However, he said the scandal was a result of ``failure of      leadership . . . lack of discipline, no training whatsoever      and no supervision'', and he criticised a command decision to      put the jail under the control of a military intelligence      unit.       Critics have argued that Mr. Rumsfeld's decision to suspend      Geneva Convention safeguards for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay,      and the transfer to Iraq of interrogation techniques used      there, helped create the conditions for the Abu Ghraib      scandal, even if no order was issued to use torture.       ``The despicable actions described in General Taguba's      report not only reek of abuse, they reek of an organised      effort and methodical preparation for interrogation,''      Democrat Senator Carl Levin said.       According to Senator Levin, an unpublished annexe to the      Taguba report stated that ``sleep management, sensory      deprivation, isolation longer than 30 days and dogs'' were      described as a ``permissible technique for use in the Iraqi      theatre'' on condition that the commanding general gave      approval ``prior to employment''.       Mr. Cambone said the techniques had been approved by U.S.      commanders in Iraq, not by the Pentagon.       However, he confirmed that Mr. Rumsfeld had last year      approved a new set of techniques, but insisted on being asked      for permission each time this ``stress matrix'' was used.       General Taguba stood by his inquiry's finding that military      police jailers should not have been involved in conditioning      Iraqi detainees for interrogation, even as Mr. Cambone      disputed that conclusion.       Mr. Cambone said that the military policy and military      intelligence needed to work closely to gain as much      intelligence as possible from the prisoners.       Mr. Cambone also said that General Taguba misinterpreted      the November order, which he said only put the intelligence      unit in charge of the prison facility, not of the military      guards.       While General Taguba depicted the abuses at the prison as      the acts of a few soldiers under a fragmented and inept      command, he also said that ``they were probably influenced by      others, if not necessarily directed specifically by others''.       His report called for an inquiry into the culpability of      intelligence officers, which is still under way.       The unusual public sparring between a two-star army general      and one of Mr. Rumsfeld's most trusted aides cast a spotlight      on the confusing conditions at the prison last year when the      worst abuses occurred, as well as the sensitive issue of      whether the Pentagon's thirst for better intelligence to      combat Iraqi insurgents contributed to the climate there.",1,

Overhead, a fan turned, but the air did      not.       The constituents' woes came down to the essentials. They      had no power, and thus no clean water--could they get      generators? They had no security--could they get weapons      permits?       If anyone could help them, it should have been the man at      the center of the scene, Dari Hamas al-Dari. In April, he was      selected by the local tribes to lead Iraq's first freely      formed town council after the fall of Saddam Hussein. Since      then, he has sat at a desk in a white robe and headdress, in      a room lined with men in tribal robes and Western dress all      looking to him for answers. He has not had many.       Mr. Dari could do nothing for the man who, lacking      electricity, stayed up all night fanning a sick child,      nothing for the 5-year-old child who was left legless by      unexploded ordnance that detonated, a sight that caused him      to weep. He could do nothing for the multitudes complaining      of cars, weapons or relatives taken by American forces, other      than give their names to the Americans. He could do nothing      for those lacking drinking water or waiting for food rations.       ``What do you tell the people--have more patience?'' he      asked rhetorically. ``Till when?''       If America has natural allies in Iraq, they are men like      Mr. Dari. He attended the American Jesuit school in Baghdad,      then university in Frankfurt. He has lived in Europe and      speaks excellent English. He maintained his independence      throughout Mr. Hussein's rule, shunning the material      blandishments with which Mr. Hussein bought the loyalty of      many tribal sheiks.       A part-time farmer and businessman, he is a member of the      sizable Zobaa tribe, which his brother leads. He welcomed the      Americans and has worked closely with their military      commanders in his area.       So the impatience creeping into his voice and the      frustration lining his handsome face bode poorly for the fate      of the American-led occupation here--even if American      officials succeed in drawing Iraqis into a new national      leadership. There is no indication that Mr. Dari, who is 64,      would turn on the Americans. He is simply losing faith in      them.       ``Conditions have never been worse,'' he said bluntly.      ``We've never been through such a long bad period.''       Abu Ghraib--a largely agricultural area just west of      Baghdad that is also home to Iraq's most notorious prison--     has had only one to three hours of power a day in recent      weeks. Drinking water cannot be pumped without electricity,      so people take water from dirty canals.       The food ration system that functioned smoothly under      Saddam Hussein is breaking down, out here at least. Trucks      leave Baghdad laden with food, but it mysteriously gets      offloaded at markets along the way.       Crime, rare under the old government, is rampant. Mr.      Dari's car was taken from him at gunpoint in Baghdad      recently. Four of his council members have been the victims      of carjacking attempts. And while the criminals are well-     armed, the Americans are disarming the victims, taking      weapons while the weapons licenses they insist on are in      short supply.       ``People here feel naked without their pistols,'' Mr. Dari      said, putting his own in a holster.       In a time of rising discontent, Mr. Dari is the buffer      between occupier and occupied. It is a role that,      historically, has earned little appreciation. Recent attacks      on Iraqis cooperating with the Americans suggest that this      chapter will be no different.       ``We are stuck between the Americans and our people,'' Mr.      Dari said of the council, which sits, for no salary, from 8      a.m. to 2 p.m. daily. ``And there were so many promises from      one side.''       Some people are calling the council members ``America      lovers'' and traitors, he said, because they are working with      the Americans.       ``He's caught in the middle,'' one of his American      partners, Lt. Col. Jeff Ingram of the First Armored Division,      acknowledged. ``He defends us a lot.''       These days, Mr. Dari is warning the American more than he      is defending them. When he first met with them, he said, he      told them      that they did not have much time to meet people's      expectations. That time is almost up, he believes.       ``I'm not threatening your with another Vietnam--God      forbid,'' he said. ``I'm just trying to get help for the      people before something happens.''       Something is already happening, of course. Out here, as      across much of Iraq, the attacks on Americans are stepping      up. Colonel Ingram said his company is being attacked at      least once a day, fortunately by men who are not very good      shots.       Colonel Ingram blames the Iraqis for most of the area's      problems, saying it is they who have torn down the power      lines he fixed, they who are robbing one another. ``The U.S.      is not the problem, it's the solution,'' he said.       But he too wonders about the slow pace of rebuilding. ``I      would have expected the U.S., the biggest country in the      world, to say here's the water purification system, here's      the big generator,'' he said.       As of the other day, neither Mr. Dari nor Colonel Ingram      had ever had any contact with the American-led civilian      administration ostensibly governing Iraq, although Mr. Dari      oversees an area that is home to 900,000 people.       So they soldier on alone, often seeking progress in vain.      The council tried to distribute generators found at a      Republican Guard camp to villages, but found that many of the      village ``representatives'' were driving out of the camp and      selling the generators. Others were being set upon by angry      mobs wanting the generators for themselves.       American soldiers were deployed to keep order, but in the      heat and chaos their tempers frayed. They broke windshields      and cursed at Iraqis, further shrinking the reservoir of good      will.       Mr. Dari said he received 10 to 12 complaints a day about      weapons, cars or relatives taken by the Americas. One man      came to report that American soldiers had taken away his deaf      relative a month ago for having a picture of Saddam Hussein      in his house, and that he had not been seen since. Officials      from an Islamic charity said the Americans had confiscated      their car and raided their office--the left both unsecured,      giving looters free rein.       Then there are the small problems. The woman who is      illegally squatting in a government building (American      soldier told Mr. Dari they could not evict her unless she      threatened someone; property rights were not their      ``purview.'') The two council members whom the council      dismissed for corruption. The effort to find the American      commander with the authority to sign a contract for garbage      collection.       Mr. Dari is just old enough to remember when the British      had an air base just west of here. They told Iraqis they had      come to liberate them from the Ottomans, he recalled, and      they stayed 40 years.       ``I hope history isn't repeating itself,'' he said, and      pressed his temples as if hoping to make the impatient men at      both elbows disappear.",1,

United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld warns      that more documentary evidence of wrongdoing at Abu Ghraib      prison lies in store, evidently in the preemptive hope that      the outrages stopped there.       As a former US military intelligence interrogator, I am      convinced that the images from Abu Ghraib are just the      beginning. The wanton cruelty there is all too clearly      symptomatic of a systemic failure.       But what system failed? Was it a failure of discipline and      training--the result of sending inexperienced and unworldly      reservists into poor conditions, abruptly extending their      deployments and then leaving them understaffed in the face of      a growing influx of captured insurgents? Or did the pattern      of abuse amount to so many orders from superiors to ``soften      up'' prisoners for interrogation?       The answer is, most likely, both and neither.       Ultimately, what gives rise to abuses such as occurred at      Abu Ghraib is a policy of deliberate ambiguity concerning how      to handle detainees. The pressure in a war setting to get      information that could save lives is immense. But senior      political and military officials--particularly in      democracies--prefer to avoid any association with torture.       Ambiguity is thus a political strategy that encourages the      spread of implicit, informal rules of behavior, thereby      shifting accountability onto the lowest ranking, least      powerful and most expendable soldiers.       I completed the US Army's three-month basic interrogation      course in the late 1980s. It was rigorous--only seven of 33      students finished it--as it required mastering the technical      minutiae of collecting, cross-checking, standardising and      reporting enormous masses of information.       But the curriculum was much less meticulous concerning      interrogation techniques. An interrogation, we were      instructed, should begin with polite, direct questioning,      because a certain number of detainees simply want to unburden      themselves. If more persuasion was needed, we could offer      rewards for cooperation--anything from cigarettes to      political asylum.       Beyond this, we were taught that we could ``apply      pressure.'' The term was never defined in any formal setting,      but the concept was not difficult to decipher. As US Army      General Antonio Taguba's report on the abuses at Abu Ghraib      put it, the ``guard force'' was ``actively engaged in setting      the conditions for successful exploitation of the      internees.''       This obvious violation of the Army's rule prohibiting      participation by military police in interrogation sessions      does not surprise me. I was never taught that military police      came under a separate chain of command. On the contrary,      between classes, during breaks in field training and in other      informal settings, some of our instructors let it be known      through insinuation and innuendo that we could have the      guards beat uncooperative subjects.       This was never said in the classroom, but it was made clear      the role of military police was to serve the interrogators,      for an interrogator's effectiveness depends on convincing the      detained of his omnipotence.       The hidden rules of the game came closest to being      officially acknowledged during two weeks of simulated      interrogations towards the end of the training course. These      sessions involved only a student interrogator, and instructor      in the role of the detainee and a video camera.       When, during a simulation, I asked an imaginary guard to      take away the detainee's chair, the instructor feigned being      removed violently. When I told the non-existent guard to hit      the detainee, the instructor played along. All of us knew      that a failed interrogation could mean being dropped from the      course. I was not dropped; I finished first in my class.       For those who benefit from the politics of ambiguity,      international law is an indispensable prop. In his recent US      Senate testimony, Mr. Rumsfeld claimed that the military      police at Abu Ghraib were instructed to abide by the Geneva      conventions.       So was I. Throughout my training as an interrogator, the      admonition to follow the Geneva conventions accompanied      virtually every discussion of ``applying pressure.''      Unfortunately, like ``applying pressure,'' the Geneva      conventions were never defined. We never studied them, nor      were we given a copy to read, much less tested on their      contents. For many of us, the conventions were at best a      dimly remembered cliche from war movies that meant, ``don't      do bad stuff.''       Again, the tacit rules said otherwise. One instructor joked      that although the Geneva conventions barred firing a 50-     caliber machine gun at an enemy soldier, we could aim at his      helmet or backpack, since these were ``equipment.'' Others      shared anecdotes about torturing detainees.       Whether such talk was true is irrelevant. We were being      conditioned to believe that the official rules set no clear      limits, and that we could therefore set the limits wherever      we liked.       In the end, the politics of ambiguity may fail Mr.      Rumsfeld; all those high-resolution photographs from Abu      Ghraib are anything but ambiguous. If similarly shameful      disclosures multiply, as I believe they will, let us at least      hope that official apologies and condemnations may finally      give way to wider, more genuine accountability and reform.",1,

When our soldiers, sailors, airmen and      Marines go into battle, we owe them the assurance that,      should they be captured by the enemy, the United States will      be able to aggressively assert their rights to humane      treatment, to be held in recognized places of detention, and      to be registered with and visited by the Red Cross, which      can raise concerns about their treatment. This is      important no matter whether military or intelligence      agents are holding our people captive. When we violate      this norm ourselves, by holding prisoners in secret--``off      the books''--denying that they are in our custody and      refusing to permit the Red Cross access to them to monitor      their treatment, we dangerously undermine our ability to      demand that our enemies adhere to it, now and in future      wars.       This is not just a theoretical concern. In 1993, when U.S.      Warrant Officer Michael Durant was captured by forces under      the control of Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, the      United States demanded assurances that Durant's treatment be      consistent with the Geneva Conventions and that the Red Cross      be given access to Durant, who was seriously wounded, to      monitor that treatment. The United States asserted that it      would afford Somali forces the same protections. Within five      days, the Red Cross was permitted to visit Durant, and he was      subsequently released.       We know from painful experience that Red Cross access to      captured prisoners can be an important prophylactic against      abuse and can help to ensure that we are in compliance with      the laws of war in the treatment of those in our custody.      Confidential Red Cross reports and recommendations alert      military commanders to serious abuses that, left unaddressed,      can undermine prison discipline      and--if exposed--undermine the war effort. It was the Red      Cross which, according to a report by Major General George      Fay, notified military authorities in Iraq about the abuses      at Abu Ghraib, leading to some of the military's first      disciplinary actions against those involved.       The Red Cross has been visiting prisoners in armed conflict      situations since the height of First World War. Under U.S.      military policy, the Red Cross is presumptively authorized to      have access to prisoners. Moreover, Department of Defense      Directive 2310.01E, issued in September 2006, mandates that      the Red Cross ``be allowed to offer its services during an      armed conflict, however characterized, to which the United      States is a party.''       Over time, the Armed Forces have built a mutually      beneficial relationship with the Red Cross and have developed      well established practices for Red Cross notification and      access to prisoners. These practices are tailored to      accommodate the demands of battlefield intelligence gathering      and detention, and do not interfere with prisoner      interrogations.       Red Cross notification and access to prisoners is an      essential buttress to the integrity of humane treatment      obligations under the Geneva Conventions. We strongly support      Amendment Number 5369 to the pending defense authorization      bill and urge its adoption into law as an important step in      restoring the moral authority of the United States and      demonstrating the commitment of our Nation to treat all      prisoners humanely.

It's news that the memo has been made public, but, sadly, what it says comes as no surprise. At least since the summer of 2004, when it was reported in the press, the American people have known that after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington the Bush Justice Department advised other agencies that the President, when acting as commander-in-chief, is not bound to follow duly enacted Federal laws.   After this was revealed, the Bush administration--preparing for the 2004 Presidential election--repudiated the memo. But it had guided the administration for 22 months, and experts have claimed that its startling reading of the law and the constitution led to excesses at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere.   In 2005, Congress responded by enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act, which requires the defense department to follow the interrogation guidelines in the Army Field Manual and which prohibits the ``cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment of persons under the detention, custody, or control of the United States Government.''   I strongly supported those provisions, which are often referred to as the ``McCain amendment' in recognition of their Senate author.   But when President Bush signed them into law, he issued a ``signing statement'' that raises serious questions about whether he intends to follow the law by suggesting that he intended to reserve the right to authorize prohibited interrogation methods in some cases.   Taken together, the memo and the signing statement clearly signal the Bush administration's contempt for the rule of law. As the Rocky Mountain News says in an April 3 editorial, ``This was one step on the path to the Bush administration's unfortunate assertion, until the courts knocked it down, that the president had the power to snatch an American citizen on U.S. soil and hold him incommunicado in solitary confinement indefinitely, without charge, trial or counsel.''   And the memo and the signing statement also show that the administration refuses to recognize that its contempt for the law will result in placing every American, especially those in uniform around the world, at grave risk.   I think we all should remember that, in the words of the Colorado Springs Gazette, ``In the larger struggle with jihadist terrorism and those tempted to support or harbor them, the perception that the United States has a certain moral authority is invaluable. Moral authority was a key factor in the long, twilight struggle with aggressive communism we call the Cold War. Using torture undermines that moral authority.''   For the information of our colleagues, I am attaching the full text of the editorial in the April 3 edition of the Rocky Mountain News.",1,

The soldiers pulled seven Iraqi detainees from their cells,      ``tossed them in the middle of the floor'' and then one      soldier ran across the room and lunged into the pile of      detainees, according to sworn statements given to      investigators by one of the soldiers now charged with abuse.      He did it again, jumping into the group like it was a pile of      autumn leaves, and another soldier called for others to join      in. The detainees were ordered to strip and masturbate, their      heads covered with plastic sandbags. One soldier stomped on      their fingers and toes.       ``Graner put the detainee's head into a cradle position      with Graner's arm, and Graner punched the detainee with a lot      of force, in the temple,'' Specialist Jeremy C. Sivits said      in his statements to investigators, referring to another      soldier charged, Specialist Charles A. Graner Jr. ``Graner      punched the detainee with a closed fist so hard in the temple      that it knocked the detainee unconscious.''       ``He was joking, laughing,'' Specialist Sivits said. ``Like      he was enjoying it.''       ``He went over to the pile of detainees that were still      clothed and he put his knees on them and had his picture      taken,'' Specialist Sivits said. ``I took this photo.''       Specialist Sivits's two statements, given to investigators      in January and released by a lawyer for another soldier on      Thursday, recount the evening's activities in graphic but      unemotional language, portraying a night of gratuitous and      random violence. Lawyers for the soldiers have explained the      abuse captured in hundreds of photographs now at the center      of the Abu Ghraib scandal by saying      the soldiers were operating on the orders of military      intelligence in an effort to get detainees to talk.       Last night, lawyers for the other charged soldiers repeated      that. They said that in a bid for leniency, Specialist      Sivits, 24, the first to be court-martialed, is expected to      plead guilty on Wednesday and testify against the others.       But Specialist Sivits described a scene of twisted      joviality not authorized by anyone in the chain of command      and with no connection to any interrogations.       ``She was laughing at the different stuff they were having      the detainees do,'' Specialist Sivits said, describing Pfc.      Lynndie R. England, another soldier charged.       The soldiers knew that what they had done was wrong,      Specialist Sivits told investigators, at least enough to      instruct him not to tell anyone what he had seen. Specialist      Sivits was asked if the abuse would have happened if someone      in the chain of command was present. ``Hell no,'' he replied,      adding: ``Because our command would have slammed us. They      believe in doing the right thing. If they saw what was going      on, there would be hell to pay.''       The evening began with Staff Sgt. Ivan L. Frederick II      casually telling Specialist Sivits to join him where the      detainees were held. They escorted the detainees from their      holding cells and piled them up. ``Graner told Specialist      Wisdom to come in and `get him some.' Meaning to come in and      be part of whatever was going to happen,''       Specialist Sivits told investigators, referring to      Specialist Matthew Wisdom.       ``A couple of the detainees kind of made an ahh sound as if      this hurt them or caused them some type of pain when Davis      would land on them,'' he said. Sergeant Javal C. Davis      responded by stepping on their fingers or toes, Specialist      Sivits said, and the detainees screamed.       The platoon sergeant standing on a tier above the room      heard the screams and yelled down at Sergeant Davis to stop,      surprising the other soldiers with the anger in his command,      Specialist Sivits said. But within two minutes, the platoon      sergeant left, and the soldiers resumed the abuse.       ``Next Graner and Frederick had the detainees strip,''      Specialist Sivits said. ``Graner was the one who told them to      strip in Arabic language.'' The detainees hesitated.      Specialist Graner and Sergeant Frederick took them aside and      instructed them again. Specialist Graner told them to sit.       ``I do not know what provoked Graner,'' Specialist Sivits      said, ``but Graner knelt down to one of the detainees that      was nude and had the sandbag over his head'' and punched the      detainee unconscious.       ``I walked over to see if the detainee was still alive,''      Specialist Sivits said. ``I could tell the detainee was      unconscious, because his eyes were closed and he was not      moving, but I could see his chest rise and fall, so I knew he      was still alive.''       Specialist Graner said little. He had wounded his hand.      ``Damn, that hurt,'' Specialist Sivits quoted him as saying.      After about two minutes, Specialist Sivits said, the detainee      moved, ``like he was coming to.'' Specialist Graner walked      over to pose with the pile of detainees.       Sergeant Frederick was standing in front of another      detainee. ``For no reason, Frederick punched the detainee in      the chest,'' Specialist Sivits said. ``The detainee took a      real deep breath and kind of squatted down. The detainee said      he could not breathe. They called for a medic to come down,      to try and get the detainee to breathe right. Frederick said      he thought he put the detainee in cardiac arrest.''       Specialist Graner, meanwhile, was having the other      detainees make a tower, all of them in a kneeling position      like a formation of cheerleaders.       ``Frederick and Graner then tried to get several of the      inmates to masturbate themselves,'' Specialist Sivits      recounted.       ``Staff Sergeant Frederick would take the hand of the      detainee and put it on the detainee's penis, and make the      detainee's hand go back and forth, as if masturbating. He did      this to about three of the detainees before one of them did      it right.''       After five minutes, they told him to stop. Specialist      Graner then had them pose against the wall, and made one      kneel in front of the other, Specialist Sivits said, ``So      that from behind the detainee that was kneeling, it would      look like the detainee kneeling had the penis of the detainee      standing in his mouth, but he did not,''       Specialist Sabrina Harman and Private England ``would stand      in front of the detainees and England and Harman would put      their thumbs up and have the pictures taken.''       Asked why the event took place, Specialist Sivits replied:      ``I do not know. I do not know if someone had a bad day or      not. It was a normal day for me, aside from the stuff I told      you about.''       Asked to describe Sergeant Frederick's attitude, he      replied, ``Same as ever, mellow.'' Specialist Harman, he      said, looked somewhat disgusted, but laughed, too, and so did      Specialist Sivits, in his own account.       ``What part did you think then was funny?'' investigators      asked. He replied, ``the tower thing.''       The evening was not an isolated case of violence,      Specialist Sivits said. He described another night when a dog      was set upon a detainee, and another when a detainee was      handcuffed to a bed.       ``Graner was in the room with him,'' he said. ``This      detainee had wounds on his legs from where he had been shot      with the buckshot.'' Specialist Graner, he said, would      ``strike the detainee with a half baseball swing, and hit the      wounds of the detainee. There is no doubt that this hurt the      detainee because he would scream he got hit. The detainee      would beg Graner to stop by saying `Mister, Mister, please      stop,' or words to that effect.''       ``I think at one time Graner said in a baby type voice,      `Ah, does that hurt?' '' Specialist Sivits added.       Guy L. Womack, a lawyer for Specialist Graner, said he had      not seen the statement from Specialist Sivits but doubted      that his client would have hit a detainee.       ``I don't think he was that kind of guy,'' Mr. Womack said.      ``He would have done it if he was ordered to do it.'' He said      that military intelligence soldiers were in one of the      graphic photographs, indicating that they were aware of what      was going on.       ``Sivits, as you know, has entered a plea agreement with      the government, getting lenient treatment for testifying      against other people,'' Mr. Womack said, ``and by definition      if he doesn't say something negative about other people he      would not get his deal.''       Similarly, a lawyer for Sergeant Frederick dismissed the      statement. ``Sivits is a rollover guilty plea, and that may      provide comfort to some,'' said the lawyer, Gary Myers. ``But      it has no impact upon the defense of any other case because      it has nothing whatsoever to do with the guilt or innocence      of my client.''       Specialist Sivits's lawyer has not responded to requests      for comments.       As for Specialist Sivits, investigators asked him in his      statements whether he thought any of the incidents were      wrong. ``All of them were,'' he replied.       Why did he not report the incidents? He replied: ``I was      asked not to, and I try to be friends with everyone. I see      now where trying to be friends with everyone can cost you.''       ``I was in the wrong when the above incidents happened,''      he said. ``I should have said something.''",,

All of us have been shocked by the published pictures of      the behavior of some American soldiers at Abu Ghraib. We      applaud the fact that this administration is prosecuting some      of the worst offenders there as well as several soldiers who      were responsible for the deaths of Afghani prisoners under      their protection in that other theater of war.       What is most disturbing, though, is that the documents that      have been made public as these cases move forward demonstrate      that the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman and      degrading treatment had been approved at the highest levels      of the Administration, that commanders in the field have      permitted much of this behavior, that directives from the      Department of Defense appear      to advocate the use of torture and other abuses, and that      even today the position of the Administration is that the      members of AI-Qaeda and other terrorist groups are not      covered by the Geneva Conventions. Recent reports from the      Red Cross and from FBI agents, for example, raise new      concerns about American treatment of detainees at Guantanamo.       We are not addressing the technical legal arguments that      characterize this discussion. Rather, we want to express our      moral concerns about the human situation--concerns that stem      from the heart of America's values, the essence of democracy,      and the soul of Jewish tradition.       We understand that the most fundamental ethical principle,      which results from our belief in God as Creator of the world      and Parent of all humanity, is that every human being is seen      as reflecting the Image of God. Torture shatters and defiles      God's Image. The purpose of torture is to remove a person's      pride, humiliate that person, or make his or her life so      painful that the person does or says whatever the      interrogator wants. Torture ``works'' by attempting to      deprive a human being of will, spirit, and personal dignity.      The humanity of the perpetrators, as well as the victims, is      inevitably compromised by the use of torture.       Jewish tradition calls for humane treatment even of one's      adversaries. In the Book of Exodus (23:4), the Bible teaches,      ``When you encounter an enemy's ox or donkey, you must take      it back to him.'' Here the religious test is, strikingly, not      how one would treat a friend, but how one relates to one's      enemy.       Classical Rabbinic texts are rigorous in prohibiting acts      of humiliation. In Jewish tort law, an additional penalty is      assessed against one who has physically injured another      person when it is found that the victim also suffered,      humiliation (boshet), while being wounded. Even verbal      humiliation is said to be the equivalent of shedding      blood. We are particularly appalled by the infliction of      sexual humiliation on prisoners under United States      custody. Jewish tradition upholds a high standard of      personal modesty. Indeed the Bible's term for prohibited      sexual behavior is to ``uncover the nakedness'' of      another. However, even non-sexual acts that overpower      people and attempt to break their will and diminish their      dignity are acts of humiliation that Jewish tradition      abhors. It is significant that nowhere in the 3000-year      long corpus of Jewish law is there any allowance for acts      of physical coercion in interrogations.       Consider the ruling of the Supreme Court of Israel, which      outlawed the use of torture in interrogations, despite the      fact that terrorist organizations have Israel's annihilation      as their express goal, carry out attacks that murder scores      of men, women, and children, and do not distinguish between      civilian and military targets. Despite this constant reality      of cruelty and merciless savagery, the Supreme Court of      Israel found no reason why tactics other than face-to-face      interrogation should be allowed against any prisoner. After      the. fact, if/when an interrogator is charged with a      violation, he is permitted to raise a defense of necessity--     i.e., his actions were necessary to prevent an imminent      attack endangering human life; but no permission is given      before the fact, even in a country facing life-threatening      terror.       At the conclusion of their decision, the Israeli jurists      acknowledge that forswearing inhumane means such as torture,      even for honorable ends,       ``* * * is the destiny of democracy, as not all means are      acceptable to it, and not all practices employed by its      enemies are open before it. Although a democracy must fight      with one hand tied behind its back, it nonetheless has the      upper hand. Preserving the rule of law and recognition of an      individual's liberty constitutes an important component in      its understanding of security. At the end of the day, they      strengthen its spirit and its strength and allow it to      overcome its difficulties.''       First, as Jewish leaders representing all the movements of      our Jewish community, in consonance with world consensus and      with the teachings of Jewish tradition in every age, we call      for a complete repudiation and prohibition of torture and      other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment for any purpose,      in any instance. We call on the U.S. government to state in      unequivocal terms that the use of any tactics of physical      abuse, the deprivation of food, water, sleep, disorientation,      religious degradation or purposive humiliation of a prisoner      is prohibited. This must be a basic understanding for the      treatment of any captive, whether or not he or she originates      from a country or belongs to a group that is a signatory to      the Geneva conventions. All those in the custody of U.S.      military, military contractors, or intelligence officials      must be provided with visits by the International Committee      of the Red Cross, in accordance with U.S. obligations under      international law.       Secondly, we note that in the trial of Specialist Charles      A. Graner, Jr., his defense lawyers argued that he was simply      following the lessons he had learned in civilian life as a      prison guard. It is shocking to think that the prelude to Abu      Ghraib may have been the treatment of our people in our own      prisons. The demonstration of the administration's commitment      to human dignity must begin at home, to insure that the same      principles of human dignity we are urging the administration      to adopt regarding foreign captives be equally applied to      American prison inmates. Otherwise, we become what we claim      to abhor.       Lastly, we call for full investigation of all allegations      of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment      committed in settings under United States control or      direction and for proper legal sanctions to be applied      against individuals who are found to have committed acts of      torture. We support the creation of a bipartisan commission      to investigate and report on the detention and interrogation      procedures of U.S. military and intelligence agencies and to      set a course of corrective action.       We look forward to hearing your views on this question and      hope that you will provide much needed moral leadership for      our nation.

(2) The terrorist violence targeted against the United      States became more emboldened after each attack, culminating      in the deadly attacks on the World Trade Center and the      Pentagon on September 11, 2001, which killed thousands of      innocent Americans, including innocent women and children.       (3) Since September 11, 2001, the citizens of the United      States have remained the priority target of terrorist      violence, with journalists and employees of non-governmental      organizations being held hostage, tortured, and decapitated      in the name of terror.       (4) Congress has authorized the President to use all      necessary and appropriate means to defeat terrorism; and on      numerous occasions since September 11, 2001, and throughout      the Global War on Terror, the interrogation of detainees has      yielded valuable intelligence that has saved the lives of      American military personnel and American citizens at home and      abroad.       (5) The interrogation of detainees has also provided highly      valuable insights into the structure of terrorist      organizations, their target selection process, and the      identities of key operational and logistical personnel that      were previously unknown to the Intelligence Community.       (6) The lawful interrogation of detainees is consistent      with the United States Constitution.       (7) The abuses against detainees documented at Abu Ghraib      prison in Iraq were deplorable aberrations that were not part      of United States policy and were not in keeping with the      finest traditions of the United States military and the      honorable men and women who serve.       (8) The loss of interrogation-derived information would      have a disastrous effect on the Nation's intelligence      collection and counterterrorism efforts and would constitute      a damaging reversal in the Global War on Terror during this      critical time.       (9) The apprehension, detention, and interrogation of      terrorists are essential elements to successfully waging the      Global War on Terror.       (10) The interrogation of detainees can and should continue      by the United States within the bounds of the United States      Constitution and the laws of the United States of America.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that      the apprehension, detention, and interrogation of terrorists      are fundamental to the successful prosecution of the Global      War on Terror.",,

Sikh nationalism barely a blip on the international radar,      was front and center Sunday at the Fremont Gurdwara Sahib,      the local Sikh house of worship, where community leaders      reaffirmed support for transforming the Indian state of      Punjab into a secular Sikh-majority state of Khalistan.       ``We know from our history that Sikhs will never be safe or      truly free unless they have a homeland of their own,'' Singh      said.       For the estimated 150,000 Sikhs living in the Bay Area,      Tuesday marks the anniversary of two of the most devastating      and seminal events in the history of the 500-year-old faith.       In 1984, with Sikhs pressing for an independent Punjab,      where they are a majority, the Indian government invaded the      Golden Temple--Sikhism's holiest place--and 36 other      religious sites where separatists were hiding, killing      thousands. The attack came on the 378th anniversary of the      torture and death of a Sikh religious leader.       Four months later, when Prime Minister Indira Ghandi was      murdered by two of her Sikh bodyguards, rioters murdered      thousands more Sikhs, who are easy to identify because the      men wore turbans and grow long beards.       The bloodbath and ensuring eight years of repression drove      many Sikhs to North America.       Now, 7,500 miles from their ancestral land, leaders of the      Fremont gurdwara won't let their brethren forget about what      transpired in India.       Photographs of 73 Sikhs murdered by Indian authorities in      1984, including the two men who killed the prime minister,      ring the gurdwara's dining room.       On Sunday, the gurdwara installed an exhibit about their      faith that included photographs of Sikh men being burned      alive or beaten by Indian soldiers. Other pictures      commemorated the 400th anniversary of the torture and murder      of Guru Arjan Dev Ji, who refused to remove references to      Islam and Hinduism from the Sikh's holy book.       ``We're trying to make people aware,'' said Ram Singh, a      gurdwara leader who plans to protest outside the Indian      Consulate in San Francisco tomorrow. ``We don't want our      future generations to forget what happened to us.''       Jasdeep Singh, an engineer, won't forget the day in 1989      when soldiers raided his graduate school boarding house and      detained all the Sikhs in an effort to gain intelligence on      separatist leaders.       ``First the clothes came off,'' he said. Later, guards tied      his hands behind his back and hung him from the ceiling.      ``These two shoulders,'' he said, ``felt like they were going      to pop out.''       Since Singh arrived in Fremont, persecution of Sikhs in      India has decreased and the governing Congress Party named a      Sikh, Mammohan Singh, to serve as prime minister.       Years of repression followed by some reforms have stifled      the independence movement in Punjab and left Sikhs in the Bay      Area divided over the nationalist cause, said Ram Singh, who      favors an independent Khalistan.       ``It's not that simple,'' said Balraj Gil as he peered at      the pictures of torture. ``You can't just get an independent      state.''",1,

At another time, President Harry Truman did not try to distance himself from abuses that occurred during his watch.

But in this institution, these      facts were of little consequence. Nothing is quite as      humbling as Justices deciding whether or not to strike down a      law you labored over for years. I was relieved when the      Court, by a margin of 6 to 3, upheld the Act.       But that visit, and others I've made over the years,      prompted me to think about the differences between the Senate      and the Supreme Court.       Senators show up to work in suits; Justices wear robes.       Senators are under the constant scrutiny of television      cameras; Justices have somehow managed to keep them out of      this Chamber.       And, of course, Senators have to run for re-election every      six years; Justices of the Supreme Court have the best job      security in the world.       So it's understandable why no fewer than 13 United States      Senators later served on the Supreme Court. That number      includes three Chief Justices--Salmon Portland Chase, Edward      Douglass White, and Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut.       I tried to comfort myself by finding what I assumed would      be an equally long list of Justices who resigned their seats      on the Court for the honor and privilege of serving in the      U.S. Senate. But that list was exactly one name long.       That lone individual, I discovered, was David Davis, U.S.      Supreme Court Justice, and later Senator from Illinois. He      was appointed to the Court by Abraham Lincoln in 1862, and      served here for 15 years before resigning in 1877 when he was      elected a Senator by the Illinois state legislature.       It should be noted, though, that the U.S. Senate wasn't his      first choice. He was a candidate for the presidential      nomination five years earlier in 1872. He sought the      nomination of what was then known as the ``Liberal      Republican'' party. Some might suggest it was that      characteristic that would make him most unique today.       I'd like to recognize, of course, Justice Souter, who has      joined us this evening. And though he isn't here today, I'd      also like to recognize Chief Justice Rehnquist.       Justice Rehnquist is a wonderful student of history who has      done so much to educate our nation and the world about this      unique institution. And as I'm sure many of you know, from      1952 to 1953 he served as a law clerk for Justice Robert      Jackson.       Last month I had the honor of participating in the      inauguration of President Bush. I don't think anyone watching      the ceremony on that day could fail to be moved by the      courage and fortitude displayed by Chief Justice Rehnquist. I      think I speak for everyone here, and countless others, as      well, in wishing him well this evening.       I'd like to thank Barrett Prettyman of the Supreme Court      Historical Society for his kind introduction, and I'd like to      thank Professor John Barrett for his historical notes as      well.       I'd also like to thank Greg Peterson of the Robert H.      Jackson Center for his remarks, and for the invitation to      speak to you this evening. And I'd like to welcome members of      the Jackson family who have joined us this evening.       If Nuremberg was the most profound experience that      influenced my father's life, there were few individuals whose      words and ideas carried greater weight with my father than      those of Robert H. Jackson.       Justice Jackson was truly an extraordinary man whose life's      journey took him from a farmhouse in upstate New York, to the      U.S. Department of Justice, where he served as Solicitor      General and Attorney General, to the Supreme Court, to a      courtroom in Nuremberg, Germany. Following Nuremberg, he      returned to this very chamber where, less than five months      before he passed away, he and his eight colleagues voted to      end racial segregation in schools across our land.       Robert Jackson graduated from neither college nor law      school.       And prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court, he had      never served as a judge. Yet he became one of the most      respected jurists of his time, one known for his      thoughtfulness, his fairness, his courage, and his      eloquently-written opinions. He was an ardent defender of the      freedoms articulated in our nation's Bill of Rights.       Of particular relevance today, Justice Jackson defended      these freedoms even during times of war, and even when he was      at odds with many of his fellow justices. He was one of only      three justices to dissent in Korematsu v. United States,      which allowed the detention of Japanese-Americans in      internment camps during World War II--a decision we now      regard as a stain on our nation's historical commitment to      freedom and justice.       Most of all, Justice Jackson was committed to promoting and      enforcing the rule of law, not only here in the United States      but around the globe, as well.       Having witnessed the horrors of Nazi Germany, he had a deep      and abiding belief that the law is humanity's strongest and      noblest weapon against tyranny and oppression.       We gather here this evening two days after the 113th      anniversary of Justice Jackson's birth, and just a few months      after the 50th anniversary of his passing on October 9, 1954.       It's fitting, as well, that we assemble here two weeks      after the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.       More than any other events, the liberation of Auschwitz and      the Nuremberg trials were the two events that laid bare      before the entire world the horrors committed by the Nazi      regime.       At liberation, the Western world saw, for the very first      time, the gas chambers, the cattle cars, and the crematoria.      They saw gruesome piles of corpses, and the emaciated few who      had survived the largest and deadliest of Hitler's death      camps. At Nuremberg, the war and the Final Solution were      painstakingly and meticulously documented and recorded so the      existence of these horrific events would never, ever be in      doubt.       With each passing day, there remain fewer and fewer of      those who can personally bear witness to the atrocities of      the Nazi regime. As a result, our generation's responsibility      becomes even greater--to ensure that the lessons we learned      six decades ago do not fade away into the mist of history.       This responsibility was one that my father took very, very      seriously--and it was reflected in how he raised his six      children. From a very early age, he would tell us about Adolf      Hitler and Heinrich Himmler, and describe places like      Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Dachau.       My father believed firmly that the value of the Nuremberg      experience would not only be in the individual sentences      meted out to the named defendants--but, in a larger sense, in      the legacy the trial would leave to future generations.       In hindsight, some might think it was inevitable that      nations like ours would judge criminals like the Nazis      according to the rule of law. In reality, there was great      debate, both here in the United States and among our allies,      over how to handle the Nazi leaders.       We know today that as many as four Supreme Court Justices,      and many others including the powerful Senator from Ohio,      Robert Taft, felt that the trials at Nuremberg would be a      case of ex post facto judgment, and would therefore be      illegal under our own Constitution. The Chief Justice at the      time, Harlan Stone, called Nuremberg a ``high-grade lynching      party.''       A great many in our nation and around the world advocated a      different treatment for captured Nazi officials--one that had      long been practiced by nations victorious in war: summary      execution. Winston Churchill was said to have supported such      a policy.       Why, so the argument went, should we show any mercy to      these criminals--men who were responsible for the ruthless      slaughter of six million Jews, and five million other      innocent men, women, and children?       Men who razed to the ground entire villages and towns and      massacred those who lived in them.       Men who launched an aggressive war that eventually claimed      over 54 million lives, and turned the European continent into      a mass graveyard.       The argument was a compelling one. But a different one      would win the day. That case was the one advocated by men      like Justice Robert Jackson and a young lawyer named Thomas      Dodd. These two and others believed that the best way to      judge these crimes against humanity, and to deter future      crimes, would be a fair, legal trial.       They insisted on the rule of law, rather than the rule of      the mob.       And so in the summer of 1945, Justice Jackson assembled not      a team of executioners, but a team of legal professionals who      would meticulously use the Nazis' own documents, records, and      testimony to prove their guilt. My father was one of the men      he chose to be on that team.       During his fifteen months at Nuremberg, my father wrote      daily letters to my mother. These beautifully written letters      always began with the words ``Grace, my dearest one.'' They      fill up this volume I hold in my hand--and a second volume of      equal length.       I had no idea that these letters even existed until the      early 1990's. Before reading these letters I, arranged them      in chronological order. I finally completed this long process      in the summer of 1995.       Without any prior awareness, you can imagine my shock when      on the evening of July 28, 1995, I sat down to begin reading      the letters and realized that the first letter to my mother      was written on July 28, 1945--50 years earlier, to the day.       My father arrived in Europe on that day with mixed      feelings. He knew that he had an opportunity to be part of a      historic occasion. But he was reluctant to leave my mother      and their children. I was only a year old at the time--and a      very active child according to my mother. Sometimes I wonder      if I was the reason my father decided to go to Nuremberg.       Ultimately, the decision was made to see the job through.      As he explained it, ``Sometimes a man knows his duty, his      responsibility so clearly, so surely, he cannot hesitate--he      dare not refuse it. Even great pain and other sacrifices seem      unimportant in such a situation. The pain is no less for this      knowledge--but the pain has a purpose at least.''       He threw himself into a job he expected would last only a      few months. In July 1945,      this 38-year-old attorney had no idea that he would be      promoted from staff counsel to trial counsel, then to senior      trial counsel, and then to Executive Trial Counsel--the      deputy prosecutor for the United States.       The Nuremberg trials themselves were an absolutely massive      undertaking, with so many questions that had to be answered:       Who would be the judges?       Who would be the lawyers?       Would the defendants be tried together or separately?       Would the trials be conducted under American or European      legal customs?       Would they be military or civilian trials?       And perhaps the most pressing practical question: Where      would the trials be held?       My father, like many, expressed reservations about holding      the trial in Nuremberg. The city, he said, was ``probably the      worst in Germany'' in terms of destruction. He suggested that      Heidelberg, which had survived the war essentially intact,      would have been a better alternative.       But for reasons of principle--if not practicality--he knew      that Nuremberg was the right choice. It was, after all,      Nuremberg where the Nazis met on September 10, 1935 to codify      into law their regime of oppression, terror, and hatred. And      so it was totally fitting that in Nuremberg, these Nazis were      brought to justice.       My father's ambivalent outlook towards his participation in      the trial changed dramatically on August 14th, 1945. On that      day, he and his fellow prosecutors began interrogating      prisoners. He described it as ``a day I shall never forget,''      and the day that followed as ``the most fascinating day of my      life.''       From August through November 1945, my father spent much of      his time face to face with some of the most vital cogs in      Hitler's murderous Nazi machine. William Keitel. Hans Frank.      Rudolph Hess. Hermann Goering. One by one, each of them would      do his best to deflect blame and to deny. My father remarked      that ``It would be relieving to hear one of them admit some      blame for something. They blame everything on the dead or      missing.''       Throughout the course of the investigation and trial, my      father became one of Justice Jackson's closest associates--     and one of his closest friends, as well.       There's no question that my father viewed Justice Jackson      as much more than a professional colleague. ``I am proud of      my association with him,'' he wrote, ``and even more proud of      his friendship.''       My father admired Jackson greatly for his keen intellect,      his quiet dignity, and for his steadfast dedication to seeing      the trial through to the end. In a letter he wrote to Justice      Jackson's son on the occasion of the Justice's passing in      1954, my father called him ``one of a very few great men whom      I have been privileged to meet in my lifetime.''       I will not go into much detail discussing the proceedings      of the trial itself. Much of the trial was actually fairly      tedious. For the most part, anyone expecting tearful      admissions of guilt was sorely disappointed.       My father, for his part, presented several aspects of the      prosecution's case, including those on concentration camps,      on economic oppression, and on slave labor. He cross-examined      numerous witnesses, including six of the defendants. Four of      those defendants were ultimately sentenced to death. The      other two served lengthy terms in prison.       For my father, though, Nuremberg was about much more than      the defendants, the evidence, and the sentences. It was about      the opportunity, as he put it, ``to write a record that will      mark a new point in man's relation with man.''       My father returned from Nuremberg with a deep commitment to      the rule of law and its role in upholding the basic human      rights and human dignity of every man, woman, and child.       That commitment is the reason why--as a Congressman and a      Senator--he was such a staunch supporter of the civil rights      movement. It's the reason he was such an ardent opponent of      Communism. And it is the reason why he embraced bold new      efforts to eliminate poverty in our nation and throughout the      world.       My father also left Nuremberg as an ardent believer in the      need to create and use law to preserve and promote human      dignity.       Nuremberg was essentially a trial without precedent. As I      mentioned earlier, when Justice Jackson and others were      developing the guidelines for the Nuremberg trials, there was      a great deal of debate and disagreement over the legality of      the proceedings.       Justice Jackson spent a great deal of time arguing why, in      fact, there was legal precedent in international law for the      crime of waging aggressive war.       But beyond those legal arguments, there was another, far      more fundamental point--a point that Robert Jackson and my      father shared. That the crimes committed by the Nazis were so      heinous, so unthinkable, that they violated the basic rules      by which all of humanity must abide.       As Justice Jackson said in his opening statement, ``The      wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so      calculated, so malignant and so devastating, that      civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored because it      cannot survive their being repeated.''       This idea of a natural law, rooted in basic standards and      norms of human behavior, was a powerful argument in favor of      the Nuremberg trials. Perhaps no document embodies the idea      that such basic standards exist more than our own Declaration      of Independence, which affirms that ``all men are created      equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain      inalienable rights, that among these rights are life,      liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.''       Natural law was a concept for which my father was a      strenuous advocate. I can remember a story he told me about a      paper he wrote at Yale for a professor of his, Harold Lasky,      a renowned socialist. In the paper, my father argued      passionately in favor of natural law theory. When he got the      paper back, a note was written on the front page: ``I      disagree with everything you have written. A Plus.''       The Nuremberg trials' lasting legacy, my father believed,      would be in international institutions that could punish      crimes against humanity, and more importantly, deter those      crimes in the future.       As he put it, ``By a declaration of criminality against      these organizations, this tribunal will put on notice not      only the people of Germany, but the people of the whole      world. Mankind will know that no crime will go unpunished      because it was committed in the name of a political party or      a state; that no crime will be passed by because it is too      big; that no criminals will avoid punishment because there      are too many.''       Regrettably, my father's and Robert Jackson's vision has      not yet been fully realized.       Over the last six decades, we have not witnessed the level      of horrific destruction and carnage perpetrated by the Nazis.      But we have seen, time and again, terrible crimes against      humanity in places like Cambodia, Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda, and      today in the Darfur province of the Sudan.       Tragically, many of the individuals involved in these      crimes--people like Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot, and Idi Amin--     were never brought to justice. In some of these cases, the      world did eventually create tribunals--but always, like      Nuremberg, temporary, ad hoc courts that were established      after the fact.       To truly be called effective, a court must not simply      punish the guilty, then disband. It must serve as a permanent      reminder to any potential criminals that they, too, will be      held accountable. Such a court can not only punish crimes--it      can deter them.       In my view, there is only one kind of institution that can      ensure the kind of accountability that can prevent future war      crimes--and that is a permanent court empowered to indict,      prosecute, and judge international criminals.       After many, many years of effort, the International      Criminal Court came into existence on July 1, 2002.      Unfortunately, rather than lend its support to this effort,      the United States has walked away from it.       I'm aware that there are complex issues that need to be      resolved regarding our nation and the International Criminal      Court. But I strongly believe that our nation's interests,      and the world's interests, would be far better served if we      worked to address those issues rather than abandoning the      entire process.       What, after all, does it say about a nation that prides      itself in upholding freedom, justice, and human rights when      it simply disengages itself from an institution whose goal is      to promote those values? And what does it say about an      institution's power to bring criminals to justice when the      most powerful nation in the world refuses to play a part?       The tragic events in Darfur today represent exactly the      kind of situation in which people like my father and Robert      Jackson envisioned international courts playing a prominent      role. It is my hope that the current administration will see      the Darfur genocide as an opportunity to participate in this      institution in some way, rather than simply standing on the      sidelines. Otherwise, the cry of ``never again'' will ring      tragically hollow.       There is another legacy of Nuremberg that is just as      powerful as its role in the development of international law.      As I mentioned earlier, the decision to hold a trial at      Nuremberg--rather than summary executions--was not an easy      choice.       We rejected the certainty of executions for the uncertainty      of a trial. We turned away from violence that was certainly      within our ability, and, many would argue, within our right.       But what we learned is that our nation became stronger, and      more respected, because we took the course that we did.       At the heart of that decision was the idea that this nation      will not tailor its eternal principles to the conflict of the      moment--and the recognition that if we did, we would be      walking in the very footsteps of the enemies we despised.       This is a principle I believe we would all do well to      remember today.       This past year, we all were horrified at the images and      stories of abuse of prisoners held in places like Abu Ghraib      in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.       The abuse itself was shocking. In my view, though, even      more troubling are the comments on this issue that we've      heard from some who occupy positions of great power in our      government.       Legal justifications for the use of torture by American      troops;       For turning over individuals to other nations known to      torture detainees;       And, perhaps most egregiously, legal justifications that      would explicitly exempt any executive branch official from      prosecution for torture ``if they are carrying out the      President's Commander-in-Chief powers.''       Sixty years ago at Nuremberg, the United States and our      allies considered the defense      ``I was just following orders'' to be so cowardly that it was      prohibited under the rules of the trial.       Perversely, there are some who consider that defense      acceptable for Americans today.       The proponents of these rationalizations tell us that we      are living in different times.       That we are facing enemies who show blatant disregard for      human life, and whose organizations transcend international      borders.       As a result, the argument goes, we must re-evaluate certain      conventions and practices that we have long respected.       I wonder how men like Robert Jackson and my father would      respond to these arguments. Would they be swayed by them?      Would they be persuaded somehow that the followers of Osama      bin Laden and Saddam Hussein are fundamentally different from      the despicable and depraved defendants who swore allegiance      to Adolf Hitler?       Would these men, who prosecuted the Nazis based on      testimony and documentary evidence, be heartened by the      argument that the best responses we can muster against evil      today are attack dogs and water-boarding?       I truly, truly think not. On the contrary, I believe that      Robert Jackson and my father would be tremendously      disappointed and saddened at some of the actions taken by      Americans on behalf of our nation--and by some of the      official legal arguments made in support of those actions.       I believe that Robert Jackson and Thomas Dodd would see      these actions as a reflection of a government that has turned      away from the lessons of history and stepped back from the      very values of due process and equal justice that we expect      of others worldwide.       Is the threat of international terrorism a dangerous one?      Unquestionably. But we cannot allow that danger to compromise      bedrock principles which have stood since the birth of our      nation--values like the right to be free from torture or from      indefinite detention without a charge.       We enshrined these values in our Constitution not simply      because we believe Americans are entitled to them. We did so      because they affirm a basic sense of human dignity in each      and every man and woman. And because we, as a nation, are      committed to upholding that dignity--even if others do not.       If we cavalierly toss aside those values in response to a      particular enemy or threat, it is not our enemies, but we who      will pay the ultimate price.       As Justice Jackson said at Nuremberg, ``we must never      forget that the record on which we judge these defendants      today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow.      To pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to      our own lips as well. ``       A century and a half ago, in his second State of the Union      address, Abraham Lincoln said that in giving or denying      freedom to slaves, ``We shall nobly save or meanly lose the      last, best hope of earth.''       The issue then was how our nation treats the enslaved.      Sixty years ago, the question was how to treat Nazi war      criminals. Today, we face the same choice with regard to the      way we treat international terrorists.       If we heed the example set at Nuremberg by people like      Robert Jackson and Thomas Dodd, if we treat our enemies      according to our standards--not theirs--we feed the flame of      liberty and justice that has rightly led our nation on its      journey for these past two and a quarter centuries.       And we set a shining and lasting example for a true global      community--one grounded in the principles of justice,      freedom, and peace.       And we live up to the great memory of Robert Jackson and of      a young counsel named Thomas Dodd.",1,

,109,0,,,2005-02-02,,dce7ef9e02679bdca0760d9956b93759,,,EXECUTIVE SESSION,,,"One of the best ways the U.S. Senate could assure the world      that the United States is serious about democracy and human      rights would be to reject the nomination of Alberto Gonzalez      as attorney general.       The Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee were united      in opposing Gonzalez, who received a vote of 10-8 from the      committee. Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking Democrat on the      committee, was firm in opposition to Gonzalez. Democrats have      flirted with the idea of a filibuster to block Gonzalez's      confirmation, but on Tuesday they rejected that idea.       It is a difficult to understand how the Arab world or      anyone else could take seriously President Bush's high-flown      rhetoric on behalf of freedom or democracy if Gonzalez became      part of his cabinet. Gonzalez has become known as Mr.      Torture. His low-key, equable manner before the committee      should not disguise the fact that during long hours of      testimony he refused to say that it was illegal for the      president to authorize torture of prisoners in the hands of      the U.S. military.       It is well known that Gonzalez was the author of memos      defining the ways that it was permissible for U.S. troops to      torture their captives. He was behind numerous policies since      ruled unconstitutional and illegal, such as the detention of      prisoners without charge and without access to a lawyer. He      was behind the military tribunals established to deal with      prisoners at the Guantanamo naval base, which have also been      thrown out by the courts.       Continuing revelations reveal that torture and other      mistreatment were the work of more than a few miscreants at      Abu Ghraib in Iraq. The International Red Cross has charged      that torture of prisoners is widespread. New reports continue      to emerge, such as that describing the sexual taunting of      prisoners by female interrogators. It is degrading for the      prisoners and for the U.S. military, and it shows the world a      face of the United States that ought to shame all Americans.       Is Alberto Gonzalez responsible for these violations? Yes.      He is not alone, of course. President Bush bears ultimate      responsibility, and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is      culpable as well. But Gonzalez was responsible for the      twisted interpretations that gave a legal gloss to policies      that spread from Guantanamo to Iraq and Afghanistan.       Gonzalez is likely to win approval from the Senate. As      Leahy noted at the time of Gonzalez's nomination, the present      Senate would probably give the nod to Attila the Hun. But a      strong voice of disapproval by senators concerned about the      way that Gonzalez and Bush have abused our democratic ideals      would remind the world that America is not unanimous in      support of the inhumane policies of the Bush administration.       Bush has pledged his support for democratic movements all      around the world. A no vote on the Gonzalez nomination would      show the world the United States, too, is struggling to be a      democracy.",,

If citizens with knowledge of wrongdoing could not or would not come forward to share what they know in confidence with members of the press, serious journalism would cease to exist, in my view.

In the Constitution, the vice      president is the Nation's understudy. He is not supposed to      be in the chain of command. Cheney knows this better than      most: In 1989, when he was George H.W. Bush's secretary of      defense, Cheney slapped down Vice President Dan Quayle for      calling a meeting of the National Security Council about a      coup attempt in the Philippines while the president was out      of the country.       Yet now the Office of the Vice President is dictating the      rules by which the U.S. military interrogates and detains      terrorist suspects. This is being done subtly. All the Office      of the Vice President has to do is informally convey its      opposition to complying with international law in this area,      and any such effort is thwarted.       This is what happened to an attempt by some officials in      the Department of Defense, along with the lawyers of all the      armed services, to write a new directive on the treatment of      detainees. Since the Bush administration began sending      foreigners captured abroad to Guantanamo Bay in winter 2001,      its refusal to afford them all the protections guaranteed by      the Geneva Conventions has been, to say the least,      internationally contentious. Now the military and some      Pentagon officials are increasingly aware that this refusal      is making American troops vulnerable abroad by potentially      provoking other countries to respond in kind. The current      policy has also created confusion in the armed services among      interrogators who were originally trained to follow Geneva      and now don't know which standard to apply. The goal of the      drafters of the new directive was to set clear standards that      are consistent with international law and with the military's      rules since 1949.       The draft directive drew upon the language from Common      Article Three of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, implying      that the United States recognized the role of international      law in governing how it treated detainees. Not everyone in      the Pentagon was happy with this. Stephen Cambone, the      undersecretary of defense for intelligence policy, and      William J. Haynes, DOD's general counsel, apparently let the      vice president's office know what was happening. In      September, David S. Addington, who was then Cheney's general      counsel, and former Cheney aide I. Lewis Libby did their best      to veto the initiative.       Cheney and Addington (and Libby) believe that there should      be no limit on the president's right to authorize      interrogations of terrorist suspects. The Office of the Vice      President is contemptuous of the British and our other      European allies, who have been reluctant to turn over      suspects to the United States because of what they see as      Washington's lawless approach.       What does the Oval Office think about adopting a Geneva-     friendly detainee policy? So far, there is no evidence that      President George W. Bush has weighed in directly since      February 2002 on applying Geneva's protections to the      detainees. At that point, he said that al-Qaida and Taliban      fighters would not have prisoner-of-war status but would      nonetheless be treated ``humanely and, to the extent      appropriate and consistent with military necessity, in a      manner consistent with the principles'' of the Geneva      Conventions. The ambiguity of Bush's 2002 statement--was he      saying that the Geneva Conventions did not trump military      necessity?--has encouraged advocates of a Geneva-based policy      to argue that he intended to set a floor rather than a      ceiling for the treatment of detainees.       And what about Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, who is in the      military chain of command? The reporting is still vague thus      far on his opinion about the standards for detainees. Matthew      Waxman, Rumsfeld's deputy assistant secretary of defense, was      a champion of incorporating Common Article Three into the new      interrogation directive. But Rumsfeld himself reportedly said      nothing, even after the vice president's office shot down the      draft directive. Rumsfeld and Cheney go way back; Cheney      worked for Rumsfeld in the Nixon administration. Whatever      else Rumsfeld's silence means, by ceding this area to Cheney,      the defense secretary signals to the armed services that he      doesn't much care that their lawyers want to bring U.S.      policy in line with the Geneva Conventions.       The military cares about Geneva's protections because of      the correlation that American intelligence officers      increasingly see between Muslim anger at the United States      for human rights abuses in Guantanamo and elsewhere and the      virulence of the insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan. In its      secret brief in a case involving the ACLU's request for the      disclosure of additional photographs of the abuses that took      place at Abu Ghraib, the government acknowledged as much.       Ordinarily presidents assign their vice presidents some      projects, usually with consultation, of course. Yet once      Cheney focuses on a policy, he dominates it.       So long as his views prevail in how the Bush administration      treats foreign detainees, the military's push to safeguard      American troops by respecting Geneva will be stymied.",1,

,111,0,,,2009-09-14,,1643af6483a39f8e89d9a21064fb2f52,,,"REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11, 2001",,,"In the fear that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks,      Americans were told that defeating Al Qaeda would require us      to ``take off the gloves.'' As a former commandant of the      U.S. Marine Corps and a retired commander-in-chief of U.S.      Central Command, we knew that was a recipe for disaster.       But we never imagined that we would feel duty-bound to      publicly denounce a vice president of the United States, a      man who has served our country for many years. In light of      the irresponsible statements recently made by former Vice      President Dick Cheney, however, we feel we must repudiate his      dangerous ideas--and his scare tactics.       We have seen how ill-conceived policies that ignored      military law on the treatment of enemy prisoners hindered our      ability to defeat al Qaeda. We have seen American troops die      at the hands of foreign fighters recruited with stories about      tortured Muslim detainees at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. And      yet Cheney and others who orchestrated America's disastrous      trip to ``the dark side'' continue to assert--against all      evidence--that torture ``worked'' and that our country is      better off for having gone there.       In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Cheney applauded the      ``enhanced interrogation techniques''--what we used to call      ``war crimes'' because they violated the Geneva Conventions,      which the United States instigated and has followed for 60      years. Cheney insisted the abusive techniques were      ``absolutely essential in saving thousands of American lives      and preventing further attacks against the United States.''      He claimed they were ``directly responsible for the fact that      for eight years, we had no further mass casualty attacks      against the United States. It was good policy . . . It worked      very, very well.''       Repeating these assertions doesn't make them true. We now      see that the best intelligence, which led to the capture of      Saddam Hussein and the elimination of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,      was produced by professional interrogations using non-     coercive techniques. When the abuse began, prisoners told      interrogators whatever they thought would make it stop.       Torture is as likely to produce lies as the truth. And it      did.       What leaders say matters. So when it comes to light, as it      did recently, that U.S. interrogators staged mock executions      and held a whirling electric drill close to the body of a      naked, hooded detainee, and the former vice president winks      and nods, it matters.       The Bush administration had already degraded the rules of      war by authorizing techniques that violated the Geneva      Conventions and shocked the conscience of the world. Now      Cheney has publicly condoned the abuse that went beyond even      those weakened standards, leading us down a slippery slope of      lawlessness. Rules about the humane treatment of prisoners      exist precisely to deter those in the field from taking      matters into their own hands. They protect our nation's      honor.       To argue that honorable conduct is only required against an      honorable enemy degrades the Americans who must carry out the      orders. As military professionals, we know that complex      situational ethics cannot be applied during the stress of      combat. The rules must be firm and absolute; if torture is      broached as a possibility, it will become a reality. Moral      equivocation about abuse at the top of the chain of command      travels through the ranks at warp speed.       On Aug. 24, the United States took an important step toward      moral clarity and the rule of law when a special task force      recommended that in the future, the Army interrogation manual      should be the single standard for all agencies of the U.S.      government.       The unanimous decision represents an unusual consensus      among the defense, intelligence, law enforcement and homeland      security agencies. Members of the task force had access to      every scrap of intelligence, yet they drew the opposite      conclusion from Cheney's. They concluded that far from making      us safer, cruelty betrays American values and harms U.S.      national security.       On this solemn day we pause to remember those who lost      their lives on 9/11. As our leaders work to prevent      terrorists from again striking on our soil, they should      remember the fundamental precept of counterinsurgency we've      relearned in Afghanistan and Iraq: Undermine the enemy's      legitimacy while building our own. These wars will not be won      on the battlefield. They will be won in the hearts of young      men who decide not to sign up to be fighters and young women      who decline to be suicide bombers. If Americans torture and      it comes to light--as it inevitably will--it embitters and      alienates the very people we need most.       Our current commander-in-chief understands this. The task      force recommendations take us a step closer to restoring the      rule of law and the standards of human dignity that made us      who we are as a nation. Repudiating torture and other cruelty      helps keep us from being sent on fools' errands by bad      intelligence. And in the end, that makes us all safer.",,

It hinges on what happens on the ground with the      insurgencies. The greater general uprising that last month's      panic-mongers had predicted has not occurred. The Sadr      insurgency appears to be waning. Senior Shiite clerics, local      leaders and demonstrators in the streets of Najaf have told      Moqtada Sadr to get out of town. Meanwhile, his militia is      being systematically taken down by the U.S. military.       As for Fallujah, we have decided that trying to fully      eradicate Sunni resistance is too costly in U.S. lives.      Moreover, this ultimately is not our job but one for the 85      percent of Iraqis who are not Sunni Arabs--the Shiites and      Kurds who will inherit the new Iraq. We have thus chosen an      interim arrangement of local self-rule in the Sunni hotbeds.      And if that gets us through the transition of power to      moderate Iraqis, fine.

Thank you for that kind introduction. It is      always great to visit the Show-Me State and Sedalia. It gives      me an excuse to stop by the ``Wheel Drive-in'' and get myself      a ``Goober Burger''. I want to thank Governor Nixon and      Congressman Skelton for their inspiring words and presence      here today as we honor our Military Heroes past and present.      I am truly honored and humbled to be asked to speak with you      today on such a momentous occasion for our Nation's military.       One of our Nation's defining Presidents, Abraham Lincoln,      once said, ``Let us have faith that right makes might, and .      . . dare to do our duty as we understand it.''       These words epitomize our military's ethical charter,      extended to us by the American people, and defined by the      ideals and precepts of our Constitution. As we enter our 9th      year of continuous war, our Nation faces an uncertain      future--a future that will most certainly require the service      and continued sacrifice of our Nation's military men and      women. As our Nation and its military embark into this      uncertain future, we must ever be mindful of President      Lincoln's words--to solemnly do our moral duty and earnestly      hope that `right makes might'.       As Americans, we are a people defined by our moral      character. Indeed, many of our forefathers came here in order      to flee religious persecution in their native lands. These      immigrants, from the Pilgrims to the Quakers to the      Mennonites, boldly forged out new lives for themselves in the      frontiers of America. Many of Missouri's early pioneers were      just such people.       Our forefathers' hard work, perseverance and strong moral      ethic helped shape our country's beginnings and define our      Nation's character. Our Founding Fathers were in many cases,      men such as these--men of substance--whose character was born      out of sacrifice and moral conviction. They understood and      rejected the yoke of oppression--they knew full well the      heavy price that must be paid to earn and maintain their      freedom. Their vision enabled the creation of a radically new      concept in the world--a nation, governed by and subservient      to its people, committed to the ideals of freedom, equality,      and justice for all. The ultimate manifestation of our      forefathers' ideals can be seen in the instrument that      established the American experiment in freedom: our Nation's      Constitution.       The pure genius of the U.S. Constitution still evokes awe      in us today. Apart from the freedoms extended to us in its      Bill of Rights, the Constitution also serves as the source      document from which we derive our military's authorities. The      governmental roadmap established by the Constitution clearly      delineates the military's subservient role to the people and      civilian authority of the military. Indeed, the Constitution      establishes a client relationship between the military and      the citizens of this Nation. Our client status requires us to      maintain a healthy and confidence-inspiring relationship with      our bosses. Trust is, and always has been, the cornerstone of      this relationship. Said another way, it is incumbent on all      of us in uniform to earn your trust and then to maintain it.       We in the Army know all too well the heavy price that must      be paid for failing to maintain the trust of the people.       In the aftermath of our Nation's last persistent conflict,      Vietnam, our Army faced a crisis of trust. Our relationship      with the American people had been strained and as an      institution, it required us to become introspective and      examine all facets of what defined us ethically as a      profession. And as a result, we enacted sweeping internal      reforms and reinforced our Professional Military Ethic in our      professional military education. But this took time and it      was only after many years of demonstrated adherence to our      Nation's principles and values that we were able to restore      the trust of the American people.       I would offer that the key ingredient that makes this      difference is leadership. Leadership grounded in the      principles of a Professional Ethic--whose foundation can be      found in the ideals and precepts of our Constitution.       Our leaders today at every level of the Army face      extraordinarily complex and uncertain situations on a daily      basis. Confronted by these unique and taxing circumstances,      influenced by character, values, and a collective ethic, our      leaders invariably will strive to make the right decisions,      and thus preserve the trust we must maintain with the clients      whom we serve.       But it is not easy and this has not always been the case.      Take Abu Ghraib for example--where we saw a failure of      leadership result not only in a loss of confidence, but in      the rallying of extremist Islam to join the Jihad.      Fortunately this leadership failure was countered by the      great work of many other leaders over a number of years.       Our Nation's military is a reflection of you--the people of      the United States. Our military is an all volunteer force,      comprised of citizens from all walks of life throughout our      country. We are a microcosm of our society--where all our      country's races, religions, and creeds--equally share in the      task of defending our Nation and its Constitution.      Consequently, our military's character and ethic is a      reflection of your own. We stand for the principles and      values that you and      our Nation hold dear. We are always mindful that our actions      and undertakings should, at all times, reflect this fact. Our      all-volunteer military is comprised of your neighbors,      friends, and relatives, who have answered America's call to      service during a time of war.       I would like to tell you the story of one such American      that answered America's call to service during war:       Rick Rescorla was not born of this country. He came to this      country from his native England in 1963, and entered the      United States Army shortly thereafter. His natural leadership      abilities were identified early on. Having graduated from      Basic Training, Rick was selected to attend Officer Candidate      School and Airborne training at Fort Benning, Georgia. Upon      graduation Rick was assigned to 2d Battalion, 7th Cavalry      Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division. It was here that he would      learn lasting lessons in service and sacrifice.       In November 1965 a young 2LT Rick Rescorla found himself      leading his men during America's first major battle of the      Vietnam War, the Battle of Ia Drang. The battle was a      vicious, guttural affair, and was vividly described by the      commanding officer of the battle, LTC Hal Moore, and war      correspondent Joe Galloway in their book, We Were Soldiers      Once . . . and Young.       In the book, Moore described Rescorla as ``the best platoon      leader I ever saw.'' Rescorla's men nicknamed him ``Hard      Core'' for his bravery in battle, and revered him for his      good humor and compassion towards his men.       Shortly after the Battle of Ia Drang commenced, Rescorla      was ordered to move out to seize the high ground surrounding      the landing zone. He immediately led his platoon forward      through the brush towards an enemy that they knew was lying      in wait. As he did this, his image was captured by a combat      cameraman--this iconic photograph adorns the cover of Moore      and Galloway's book. In the picture, his face muscles are      taut and eyes wide under the brow of his helmet. His eyes      look almost white because they are open so wide . . . intense      anxiety is plainly evident in LT Rescorla's face. He is very      clearly afraid . . . afraid that his life may be snuffed out      at any moment, yet he moves with his M-16 at the ready,      clenched firmly in his hands, its bayonet fixed--a Soldier      dutifully doing what is asked of him despite the danger.       The picture--captured in a moment of desperation and sheer      terror--is a powerful image of a Soldier doing his duty in      combat. It's quite probable that LT Rescorla didn't really      know why it was necessary to move his platoon forward and      take the high ground, but he felt a compelling responsibility      both to his fellow Soldiers and unit to do his duty. Rescorla      did his duty that day earning a Silver Star for his valor.      Yet, this was not the last time that his nation would require      his service and his ultimate sacrifice.       The final chapter of the Rick Rescorla story is even more      moving. On September 11, 2001, Rick was serving as Vice      President of Security for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in its      headquarters in the South Tower of the World Trade Center in      New York City. After the building was struck on that fateful      morning, Rescorla calmly and expertly directed over 2700      employees to safety down the fire escape stair wells of the      South Tower. Rescorla also oversaw the evacuation of another      1000 employees from the World Trade Building #5. When an old      Army buddy, Dan Hill, reached him on the phone that day,      Rescorla could be heard barking orders calmly and collectedly      through a bullhorn. He exhorted his fellow employees to ``be      proud to be Americans . . . everyone will be talking about      you tomorrow.''       After the last of the employees had evacuated the South      Tower, he took his security team back into the building to      make a final sweep to ensure everyone had escaped safely.      When one of his colleagues urged him to evacuate as well,      Rescorla replied, ``As soon as I make sure everyone else is      out.'' He was last seen alive on the tenth floor, moving      towards danger much in the same way he had done 36 years      prior at the Battle of Ia Drang. Rick Rescorla certainly knew      the mortal danger he faced, yet did his duty for his fellow      man.       Rick Rescorla was not the last hero to die in our Nation's      Global War on Terror. His actions along with hundreds of      others that momentous day sparked a renewed era of sacrifice      and service in our country.       Many in this country do not yet fully realize the      incredible value and impact that this 9/11 generation is      having, and will continue to have, on our society--for they      are a humble, resilient and selfless generation. They all      remember exactly where they were 9 years ago when the planes      went into the World Trade Center, and into the field in PA,      and into the Pentagon. They are volunteers all of them, and      our Country has placed the security of our Nation on their      backs, again, and again, and again. And yet despite the      repeated sacrifices, they have answered the call to duty each      time, and stood in the gap between the evil that is out there      and our way of life. They have never wavered or questioned.      They quietly stand among the generations of Americans that      have gone before, standing in the gap between the evil that      is out there, and the values of our Nation and our way of      life.       I have no doubts that history will gloriously record their      service and sacrifice, for it has protected the free world      from tyranny and evil, and has restored freedom and inspired      hope where it was absent. As was the case with our      forefathers, they do not seek exclusion and intolerance and      violence, but rather they seek moderation, and tolerance, and      inclusion. They protect, defend, and advocate for the      downtrodden and defenseless. They are indeed a reflection of      you--the American people.       In closing, I ask that we all remember those service      members who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of      our Nation. We are forever indebted to them for their service      and sacrifice.       May we also remember those that are, at this very moment,      standing watch for us around the globe in the name of freedom      and democracy.       God bless the great state of Missouri.       May God bless and protect our Service members in harm's      way, as well as their families back home.       And may God continue to bless the United States of America.       Army Strong.",1,

                  ON TERROR, AND TSUNAMI RELIEF, 2005",MICHIGAN,0.42997625210911578,"Washington--The latest chapter in the legal history of      torture is being written by American pilots who were beaten      and abused by Iraqis during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. And it      has taken a strange twist.       The Bush administration is fighting the former prisoners of      war in court, trying to prevent them from collecting nearly      $1 billion from Iraq that a federal judge awarded them as      compensation for their torture at the hands of Saddam      Hussein's regime.       The rationale: Today's Iraqis are good guys, and they need      the money.       The case abounds with ironies. It pits the U.S. government      squarely against its own war heroes and the Geneva      Convention.       Many of the pilots were tortured in the same Iraqi prison,      Abu Ghraib, where American soldiers abused Iraqis 15 months      ago. Those Iraqi victims, Defense Secretary Donald H.      Rumsfeld has said, deserve compensation from the United      States.       But the American victims of Iraqi torturers are not      entitled to similar payments from Iraq, the U.S. government      says.       ``It seems so strange to have our own country fighting us      on this,'' said retired Air Force Col. David W. Eberly, the      senior officer among the former POWs.       The case, now being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court,      tests whether ``state sponsors of terrorism'' can be sued in      the U.S. courts for torture, murder or hostage-taking. The      court is expected to decide in the next two months whether to      hear the appeal.       Congress opened the door to such claims in 1996, when it      lifted the shield of sovereign immunity--which basically      prohibits lawsuits against foreign governments--for any      nation that supports terrorism. At that time, Iraq was one of      seven nations identified by the State Department as      sponsoring terrorist activity. The 17 Gulf War POWs looked to      have a very strong case when they first filed suit in 2002.      They had been undeniably tortured by a tyrannical regime, one      that had $1.7 billion of its assets frozen by the U.S.      government.       The picture changed, however, when the United States      invaded Iraq and toppled Hussein from power nearly two years      ago. On July 21, 2003, two weeks after the Gulf War POWs won      their court case in U.S. District Court, the Bush      administration intervened to argue that their claims should      be dismissed.       ``No amount of money can truly compensate these brave men      and women for the suffering that they went through at the      hands of this very brutal regime and at the hands of Saddam      Hussein,'' White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan told      reporters when asked about the case in November 2003.       Government lawyers have insisted, literally, on ``no amount      of money'' going to the Gulf War POWs. ``These resources are      required for the urgent national security needs of rebuilding      Iraq,'' McClellan said.       The case also tests a key provision of the Geneva      Convention, the international law that governs the treatment      of prisoners of war. The United States and other signers      pledged never to ``absolve'' a state of ``any liability'' for      the torture of POWs.       Former military lawyers and a bipartisan group of lawmakers      have been among those who have urged the Supreme Court to      take up the case and to strengthen the law against torturers      and tyrannical regimes.       ``Our government is on the wrong side of this issue,'' said      Jeffrey F. Addicott, a former Army lawyer and director of the      Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University in San      Antonio. ``A lot of Americans would scratch their heads and      ask why is our government taking the side of Iraq against our      POWs.''       The POWs' journey through the court system began with the      events of Jan. 17, 1991--the first day of the Gulf War. In      response to Hussein's invasion of Kuwait five months earlier,      the United States, as head of a United Nations coalition,      launched an air attack on Iraq, determined to drive Iraqi      forces from the oil-rich Gulf state. On the first day of the      fighting, a jet piloted by Marine Corps Lt. Col. Clifford      Acree was downed over Iraq by a surface-to-air missile. He      suffered a neck injury ejecting from the plane and was soon      taken prisoner by the Iraqis. Blindfolded and handcuffed, he      was beaten until he lost consciousness. His nose was broken,      his skull was fractured, and he was threatened with having      his fingers cut off. He lost 30 pounds during his 47 days of      captivity.       Eberly was shot down two days later and lost 45 pounds      during his ordeal. He and several other U.S. service members      were near starvation when they were freed. Other POWs had      their eardrums ruptured and were urinated on during their      captivity at Abu Ghraib.       All the while, their families thought they were dead      because the Iraqis did not notify the U.S. government of      their capture.       In April 2002, the Washington law firm of Steptoe  Johnson      filed suit on behalf of the 17 former POWs and 37 of their      family members. The suit, Acree vs. Republic of Iraq, sought      monetary damages for the ``acts of torture committed against      them and for pain, suffering and severe mental distress of      their families.''       Usually, foreign states have a sovereign immunity that      shields them from being sued. But in the Anti-Terrorism Act      of 1996, Congress authorized U.S. courts to award ``money      damages . . . against a foreign state for personal injury or      death that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial      killing, aircraft sabotage [or] hostage taking.''       This provision was ``designed to hold terrorist nations      accountable for the torture of Americans and to deter rogue      nations from engaging in such actions in the future,'' Sens.      Susan Collins (R-Maine) and George Allen (R-Va.) said last      year in a letter to Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft that urged him      to support the POWs' claim.       The case came before U.S. District Judge Richard W.      Roberts. There was no trial; Hussein's regime ignored the      suit, and the U.S. State Department chose to take no part in      the case.       On July 7, 2003, the judge handed down a long opinion that      described the abuse suffered by the Gulf War POWs, and he      awarded them $653 million in compensatory damages. He also      assessed $306 million in punitive damages against Iraq.      Lawyers for the POWs asked him to put a hold on some of      Iraq's frozen assets.       No sooner had the POWs celebrated their victory than they      came up against a new roadblock: Bush administration lawyers      argued that the case should be thrown out of court on the      grounds that Bush had voided any such claims against Iraq,      which was now under U.S. occupation. The administration      lawyers based their argument on language in an emergency      bill, passed shortly after the U.S. invasion of Iraq,      approving the expenditure of $80 billion for military      operations and reconstruction efforts. One clause in the      legislation authorized the president to suspend the sanctions      against Iraq that had been imposed as punishment for the      invasion of Kuwait more than a decade earlier.       The president's lawyers said this clause also allowed Bush      to remove Iraq from the State Department's list of state      sponsors of terrorism and to set aside pending monetary      judgments against Iraq.       When the POWs' case went before the U.S. Court of Appeals      for the District of Columbia Circuit, the three-judge panel      ruled unanimously for the Bush administration and threw out      the lawsuit.       ``The United States possesses weighty foreign policy      interests that are clearly threatened by the entry of      judgment for [the POWs] in this case,'' the appeals court      said.       The administration also succeeding in killing a      congressional resolution supporting the POWs' suit. ``U.S.      courts no longer have jurisdiction to hear cases such as      those filed by the Gulf War POWs,'' then-Deputy Secretary of      State Richard L. Armitage said in a letter to lawmakers.      ``Moreover, the president has ordered the vesting of blocked      Iraqi assets for use by the Iraqi people and for      reconstruction.''       Already frustrated by the turn of events, the former POWs      were startled when Rumsfeld said he favored awarding      compensation to the Iraqi prisoners who were abused by the      U.S. military at Abu Ghraib.       ``I am seeking a way to provide appropriate compensation to      those detainees who suffered grievous and brutal abuse and      cruelty      at the hands of a few members of the U.S. military. It is the      right thing to do,'' Rumsfeld told a Senate committee last      year.       By contrast, the government's lawyers have refused to even      discuss a settlement in the POWs' case, say lawyers for the      Gulf War veterans. ``They were willing to settle this for      pennies on the dollar,'' said Addicott, the former Army      lawyer.       The last hope for the POWs rests with the Supreme Court.      Their lawyers petitioned the high court last month to hear      the case. Significantly, it has been renamed Acree vs. Iraq      and the United States.       The POWs say the justices should decide the ``important and      recurring question [of] whether U.S. citizens who are victims      of state-sponsored terrorism [may] seek redress against      terrorist states in federal court.''       This week, Justice Department lawyers are expected to file      a brief urging the court to turn away the appeal.",1,

First, in sheer human terms, there is a code to be followed      for prisoners' treatment. It exists for good reasons,      starting with simple decency and progressing to the hope that      rules observed by one side will be observed by the other.      These soldiers trashed such considerations.       Second, they did immeasurable harm to the goals of America      and its allies to bring about a peaceable and effective      transfer of limited self rule to Iraqis. They rendered      considerably more dubious the prospect of inculcating a      stable, beneficial democracy in the Middle East. (If this is      what democracy brings, who would want it?)       The six men who engaged in the actual acts (pyramids of      naked detainees, false electrocution threats and more) face      criminal charges. They should. In addition, six supervisors      will receive a reprimand that can end their careers by      rendering promotions impossible. A seventh will draw a lesser      penalty.       An internal Army report in February pointed to flaws in the      command structure at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere. For one thing,      an intelligence officer whose duty was eliciting information      from the prisoners was effectively put in charge of their      day-to-day jailers--a dangerous practice, as events have      shown. Additionally, the military policy responsible for the      prisoners appear to have had little or no training in proper      handling of detainees.       Such flaws cry out to be remedied, and apparently that will      now happen. But that still leaves the question, what happened      to common sense? America, for all its good intentions, is      already regarded with suspicion by many in the Middle East      and in Iraq in particular. Who could suppose that when      knowledge of these abominable acts leaked, as was bound to      happen, it would do anything less than throw gasoline on an      already smoldering fire?       The United States needs to find some way to make clear in      Iraq that this is not the norm, and that Americans, too, are      repelled by what they saw. This isn't supposed to happen.      We're the good guys. But try telling that today to the      average Iraqi",0,

There was a time, not so long ago, when commanders were      expected to be accountable for the behavior of their      subordinates.       That's changed. Under Commander in Chief George W. Bush,      the notion of command accountability has been discarded. In      Mr. Bush's world of war, it's the grunts who take the heat.      Punishment, is reserved for the people at the bottom. The      people who foul up at the top are promoted.       It was a year ago today that the stories and photos of the      shocking abuses at Abu Ghraib prison first came to the      public's attention. It was a scandal that undermined the      military's reputation and diminished the standing of the U.S.      around the world.       It would soon become clear that the photos of hooded, naked      and humiliated detainees were evidence of a much larger      problem. The system for processing, interrogating and      detaining prisoners at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere in Iraq was      dangerously out of control, and the command structure      responsible for it had collapsed. Detainees were beaten,      tortured, sexually abused and, in some instances, killed.      Many detainees should never have been imprisoned at all, as      they had committed no offenses.       So what happened? A handful of grunts were court-martialed,      a Marine major was cashiered, and the Army plans to issue a      new interrogation manual that bars certain harsh techniques.      There was no wholesale crackdown on criminal behavior.       We learned last week that after a high-level investigation,      the Army had cleared four of the five top officers who were      responsible for prison policies and operations in Iraq. The      fifth officer, Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski of the Army      Reserve, had already been relieved of her command of the      military police unit at Abu Ghraib. (She has complained, and      not without reason, that she was a scapegoat for the failures      of higher-ranking officers.)       As Eric Schmitt wrote in The Times: ``Barring new evidence,      the inquiry by the Army's inspector general effectively      closes the Army's book on whether the highest-ranking      officers in Iraq during the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, should      be held accountable for command failings described in past      reviews.''       This is the way atrocities are dealt with in Mr. Bush's      world of war. The higher-ups responsible for training,      supervising and disciplining the troops--in other words, the      big shots who presided over a system that ran shamefully      amok--escaped virtually unscathed.       The abuses at Abu Ghraib, which seemed mind-boggling at the      time, turned out to be symptomatic of the torture, abuse and      institutionalized injustice that have permeated the Bush      administration's operations in its so-called war against      terror. Euphemisms like rendition, coercive interrogation,      sleep adjustment and waterboarding are now widely understood.      Yes, Virginia, it is the policy of the United States to      kidnap individuals and send them off to regimes skilled in      the art of torture.       Two things are needed. First, a truly independent      commission, along the lines of the bipartisan 9/11 panel,      should be set up to thoroughly investigate U.S. interrogation      and detention operations and make recommendations to correct      abuses.       Second, the U.S. government should make it clear, beyond      any doubt, that torture and any other inhumane treatment of      prisoners is wrong, just flat wrong, and will not be      tolerated under any circumstances.       ``In our contemporary world, torture is like the slave      trade or piracy was to people in the 1790's,'' said Michael      Posner, executive director of Human Rights First, which is      suing Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld over the prisoner      abuse issue. ``Torture is a crime against mankind, against      humanity. It's something that has to be absolutely      prohibited.''       If the president made it clear that men and women up and      down the chain of command would be held responsible for the      abuses that occur on their watch, the abuses would plummet.      Instead, the message the administration has sent is that its      demands for accountability will be limited to a few hapless,      ill-trained grunts.       The big shots who presided over behavior that has shamed      America in the eyes of the world can count on this      president's embrace.",1,

We write because this      issue above all demands clarity: Waterboarding is inhumane,      it is torture, and it is illegal.       In 2006 the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on the      authority to prosecute terrorists under the war crimes      provisions of Title 18 of the U.S. Code. In connection with      those hearings the sitting Judge Advocates General of the      military services were asked to submit written responses to a      series of questions regarding ``the use of a wet towel and      dripping water to induce the misperception of drowning (i.e.,      waterboarding). . . ,'' Major General Scott Black, U.S. Army      Judge Advocate General, Major General Jack Rives, U.S. Air      Force Judge Advocate General, Rear Admiral Bruce MacDonald,      U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General, and Brigadier Gen. Kevin      Sandkuhler, Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant of the      U.S. Marine Corps, unanimously and unambiguously agreed that      such conduct is inhumane and illegal and would constitute a      violation of international law, to include Common Article 3      of the 1949 Geneva Conventions.       We agree with our active duty colleagues. This is a      critically important issue--but it is not, and never has      been, a complex issue, and even to suggest otherwise does a      terrible disservice to this Nation. All U.S. Government      agencies and personnel, and not just America's military      forces, must abide by both the spirit and letter of the      controlling provisions of international law. Cruelty and      torture--no less than wanton killing--is neither justified      nor legal in any circumstance. It is essential to be clear,      specific and unambiguous about this fact--as in fact we have      been throughout America's history, at least until the last      few years. Abu Ghraib and other notorious examples of      detainee abuse have been the product, at least in part, of a      self-serving and destructive disregard for the well-     established legal principles applicable to this issue. This      must end.       The Rule of Law is fundamental to our existence as a      civilized nation. The Rule of Law is not a goal which we      merely aspire to achieve; it is the floor below which we must      not sink. For the Rule of Law to function effectively,      however, it must provide actual rules that can be followed.       In this instance, the relevant rule--the law--has long been      clear: Waterboarding detainees amounts to illegal torture in      all circumstances. To suggest otherwise--or even to give      credence to such a suggestion--represents both an affront to      the law and to the core values of our Nation.       We respectfully urge you to consider these principles in      connection with the nomination of Judge Mukasey.           Sincerely,         Rear Admiral Donald J.

I am becoming increasingly concerned that the Secretary, and the Administration, are missing the point of this growing scandal.   Of course there is a need to investigate individual wrongdoing and hold people accountable for their acts according to the Code of Military Justice. But much more needs to be done. I see little evidence that there has been adequate planning for the management and function of military detention facilities in Iraq, and this failure needs to be addressed now.   This is critical for the three reasons I outlined above. In essence, military detention facilities should be looked upon exactly like other elements of war-planning--necessary to fight successfully, but carrying risks to our soldiers and to our mission.   I am concerned that this function has not been adequately planned. It does not surprise me that we see the lack of planning becoming apparent in the revelation of individual misconduct, but I think it is critical that the Department of Defense take on the larger issue, and take it on immediately.   The situation is grim. Each of the three risks I mentioned have come to be.   Some of our soldiers, inadequately supervised and poorly commanded, have succumbed to the moral hazards of running a prison. I do not excuse their actions, and they will be held accountable for their actions. But it is predictable that without adequate command and control such conduct will happen in a prison, and for that Secretary Rumsfeld and senior Army commanders are responsible.   It is clear that the potentially valuable source of tactical intelligence that could have been gained through the competent and professional administration of military detention facilities was wantonly thrown away by allowing those facilities to degenerate into a chaotic and ungoverned free-for-all.   It is my view that there is a place for properly conducted interrogation in the context of a military detention facility.   But it seems to me that what we have seen is not overly aggressive interrogation, but wanton cruelty and abuse, unconnected with any doctrinally acceptable method of prisoner interrogation.   We will never know what potentially valuable tactical intelligence was lost in the chaos of Abu Ghraib prison, but I am confident that whatever intelligence was there was unlikely to have been elicited in that environment.   Again, Secretary Rumsfeld and senior commanders are responsible for this failure, and I call upon them to immediately remedy this situation.   We have troops on the ground, under fire, and we cannot afford to abandon a mechanism for gathering intelligence which could help make our troops safer.   Finally, the failure to run this element of our war effort competently has resulted in a catastrophic setback to our strategic interests.   It should have been self-evident that failure to run U.S. detention facilities in a professional, competent and lawful manner would, when made public, adversely affect our prospects in Iraq and in the region.   Simply put, American soldiers will come under increasing fire because of the failure to run the prisons correctly, and whatever prospects remain for peacefully transferring power to an Iraqi government have been diminished.   In sum, it is important to recognize that planning for detention and interrogation of prisoners is as much a part of war planning as making sure that there is enough gas for tanks, enough ammunition for guns and armor for our soldiers.   I am concerned that the failure to plan for this aspect of the war is consistent with a general pattern at the Pentagon--an unwillingness to plan for the realities of Iraq and the Middle East. We will all pay for that failure.   One key part of the resolution speaks to the roll of the Congress, noting that ``the best interests of the United States and the American people will be served by a full investigation by the appropriate Committees of the United States Senate exercising their oversight responsibilities.'' This is a critical point. This body must immediately begin its task of addressing this issue.   There are a few particular questions upon which I hope we will focus:   Whether, and to what extent, the conditions and procedures in Abu Ghraib and other prisons came about because of particular policy decisions by senior officials. For instance, who made the decision, reported in the media, to use prison guards to ``set the conditions'' for interrogations?   Why was the critical task of administering Abu Gharaib entrusted to soldiers without adequate training or guidance?   Who in the command structure is responsible for maintaining and administering our military program to detain and interrogate prisoners in Iraq and elsewhere?   I hope we can answer these, and other questions, and make the changes necessary to make our nation safer.",1,

We all know      that international law is often challenged by the caprices      and diverging interests of national politics and that it      still lacks the authority of national law. With a few      important exceptions, international law remains      unenforceable; when it collides with the sovereign interests      or the ambitions of states, it is often ignored or rejected.      It is still far from being the respected foundation of a      reliable international system.       In the first years of the new millennium, and especially      after the terrorist attacks of September 11, the development      of international law has encountered an unexpected and      formidable obstacle--the ideological opposition of the Bush      administration, both to vital treaties and to international      institutions. This attitude culminated in the 2003 invasion      of Iraq without the specific authorization of the UN Security      Council, and without allowing UN inspectors to complete their      work. Prisoners captured by the US were denied the protection      of the Geneva Conventions and were often treated brutally. It      is therefore no surprise that the three very different books      under review all end by deploring the United States' war for      regime change in Iraq and the illegal abuses that have      accompanied it.       It is ironic that such widespread criticism should be      incurred by the US. From the Permanent Court of International      Justice in The Hague, the Covenant of the League of Nations,      and the Charter of the United Nations to the Universal      Declaration of Human Rights and many UN conventions, the US      has done more than any other country to develop and      strengthen both the concept and the substance of      international law. It is nothing less than disastrous that      a United States administration should have chosen to show      disrespect for the international legal system and weaken      it at a time when the challenges facing the planet demand      more urgently than ever the discipline of a strong and      respected worldwide system of law. Those challenges      include globalization at almost every level of human      society, the deeply troubling evidence of climate change,      and the linked threats of international terrorism and      proliferating weapons of mass destruction. It is true that      the United States remains broadly committed to the      international rules on trade of the World Trade      Organization and NAFTA, rules that are important to the      United States not least because they protect the rights of      US investors and intellectual property rights.       Philippe Sands is a practicing international lawyer and      professor in London. Having been involved in many cases      before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, he      took part in the effort to deny Augusto Pinochet immunity in      the UK and has represented the British detainees at      Guantanamo.       Along with the other books under review, Sands's Lawless      World provides a disturbing picture of the state of      international law and the part, at times visionary, at other      times destructive, that the US had in its development. Sands      indicts the United States, with Tony Blair's complicity, for      abandoning its commitment to the post-World War II legal and      institutional arrangements that both countries, more than      anyone else, had put in place. ``I am not starry-eyed about      international law,'' Sands writes. ``I recognize that it has      frequently failed millions around the world and will continue      to do so. But do recent events justify a wholesale change of      approach?''       Before World War II, governments could act more or less as      they wished in international affairs, provided they had the      power to do so. This situation began to change radically when      Roosevelt and Churchill proclaimed the Atlantic Charter on a      battleship off the coast of Newfoundland on August 14, 1941,      at a time when Nazi Germany appeared to be decisively      winning the European war. This first sketch of the UN      Charter and the international system that was to regulate      the postwar world was based on three simple but      revolutionary principles. First, states would recognize      the obligation to refrain from the use of force in their      international relations, and would resort to force only in      self-defense or when authorized to do so by the      international community--later to be represented by the UN      Security Council. Second, they would maintain and respect      the ``inherent dignity'' and ``equal and inalienable      rights'' of all members of the human family. Third, they      would promote economic liberalization and progress through      free trade and other means.       The Atlantic Charter marked the beginning of the long      process that led to the establishment of the UN, the various      UN specialized agencies, the World Bank and the International      Monetary Fund, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade      (which after forty-five years became the World Trade      Organization), and the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human      Rights (in Sands's words ``arguably the single most important      international instrument ever negotiated''), as well as the      Geneva Conventions of 1949 and 1977.       Further steps toward establishing an international      institutional and legal order continued with the 1957      International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, which has now      become an important monitoring and inspection agency; the      Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and other arms control      conventions; environmental law and institutions; and now the      International Criminal Court, and the beginning of a system      of legal obligations for states related to the prevention and      suppression of international terrorism.       Throughout Lawless World Sands's main preoccupation is the      damage that current United States policies and actions may do      to the respect for international law and its authority, both      of which may be decisive in dealing effectively with the      global challenges that lie ahead. His concern is well      justified. As he notes, the 1997 manifesto of the      neoconservative organization Project for the New American      Century, signed by such people as Dick Cheney, Paul      Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld, and Scooter Libby, proclaimed      that the detention of Augusto Pinochet, the new International      Criminal Court, and the Kyoto Protocol on global warming      were all threats to American security. John Bolton, now      United States ambassador at the UN, said at the time that      treaties were simply political acts and ``not legally      binding.'' Richard Perle declared publicly in April 2003      that the war in Iraq provided an opportunity to refashion      international law and undermine the United Nations.       Sands is particularly concerned about the frenzied      opposition of the Bush administration to the new      International Criminal Court, which has been accepted by one      hundred other nations and is now investigating the current      genocide in Darfur. The Bush administration, he writes, is      using the ICC as ``a useful stalking horse for a broader      attack on international law and the constraints which it may      place on hegemonic power.''       As for the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, Sands recalls      with nostalgia that in 1970, another Republican president,      Richard Nixon, signed into law the National Environmental      Policy Act, the world's first comprehensive attempt to      protect the environment. The UN Charter makes no mention of      rules governing the environment. Nixon vigorously      supported an environmental program within the UN, and just      before the UN's first global conference on the environment in      Stockholm in 1972, he proposed a World Heritage Trust to      protect regions of such unique worldwide value that they      should be treated as part of the heritage of all mankind. The      United States was also a leader in adopting the first      measures, taken under the Reagan administration in the 1980s,      to counteract the depletion of the ozone layer; it did so      against the opposition of European governments that were      worried about possible unfavorable economic consequences.       Since 1990, when the report of the UN's International Panel      on Climate Change revealed a deadly potential threat to      islands and other low-lying regions that clearly called for a      timely global response, Sands himself has been deeply      involved in such issues. He makes it clear that short-term      economic considerations have so far taken precedence over the      enormous long-term risks involved in doing too little about      climate change.       As he points out, the United States and OPEC initially      opposed an international convention on climate change or any      timetables to reduce and stabilize the emission of greenhouse      gases. A preliminary convention, in a very modest form, came      into force in 1994. In 1997 the Kyoto Protocol marked a real      commitment to action and provided a basis for more far-     reaching measures. In signing it, President Clinton praised      the protocol as a major step forward. Sands writes that      Clinton was then informed somewhat mystifyingly by former      Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and a number of other      Regan and Bush officials that the protocol would      ``hamstring'' American military operations and undermine      American sovereignty. The Bush administration soon      ``unsigned'' the Kyoto Protocol, claiming among other      reasons that the scientific verdict on global warming was      not yet in. Alone of all industrialized states, the United      States and Australia have not ratified the protocol.      Whatever its defects in not adequately controlling      emissions from the large Asian economies, it remains an      essential preliminary step toward limiting climate change.       The invasion of Iraq that started in March 2003 arouses      Sands's deepest objections to what he sees as an unwarranted      assault on international law. The invasion itself, without      benefit of Security Council authorization, was a blow to the      essential basic principle contained in Article 2.4 of the UN      Charter, which reads:       ``All Members shall refrain in their international      relations from the threat or use of force against the      territorial integrity or political independence of any state,      or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the      United Nations.''       Sands is equally concerned with the violation of      international laws in connection with the conduct of the war.      In the Guantanamo prison hundreds of alleged ``killers,''      ``terrorists,'' or ``unlawful combatants,'' as they have been      variously designated by the United States, have been      deliberately put, he writes, into a ``legal black hole,''      from which most of them are unlikely to emerge anytime soon.      The basic principle of habeas corpus has seldom if ever taken      such a beating at the hands of a leading democracy. The      atrocities at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere are plainly in      violation of the Geneva Conventions and the UN Convention      against Torture. They also set a terrible precedent for the      future treatment of captured Americans.       The 1899 Hague Convention, which puts limits on methods of      interrogation of prisoners of war; the four 1949 Geneva      Conventions, which deal, among many other matters, with      treatment of prisoners; and Article 75 of the Geneva      Protocol I of 1977 mean, in Sands's judgment, that ``no      person can ever fall outside the scope of minimum legal      protections'' against violence, torture, threats of      torture, outrages against personal dignity including      humiliating and degrading treatment, and any form of      indecent assault. This list certainly describes what      happened in Abu Ghraib and other prisons.       Of course these rules have often been violated by other      states, but the United States, since 2001, is unique in      claiming, in the words of Deputy Assistant Attorney General      John Yoo in 2002, ``What the Administration is trying to do      is create a new legal regime.'' This was also presumably the      basic notion behind Bush's proclaiming the right to resort      unilaterally to preventive war as part of his new national      security strategy. To minimize legal constraints on the      United States and to extract information from prisoners,      Alberto Gonzales, then White House general counsel and now      attorney general of the United States, urged the President to      declare that the Geneva Convention III of 1949 did not apply      to al-Qaeda or the Taliban. ``This new paradigm,'' Gonzales      wrote in January 2002, ``renders obsolete Geneva's strict      limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders      quaint some of its provisions. . . .''       Although Guantanamo, because it was not in US territory,      was chosen partly to avoid such interference, from time to      time the US judiciary has tried to stem the administration's      flood of expedient revisionism. A federal judge halted the      first hearing, after nearly three years, before a special      military commission established to try non-American      Guantanamo prisoners. He did so on the grounds that the      proceedings lacked the basic elements of a fair trial and      violated the Geneva Conventions.       Sands is particularly good at picking, from an amazing      wealth of material, quotations that capture the eerie      atmosphere of the Bush administration in the midst of a war      of choice and an unprecedented assault on international law.      On the Guantanamo inmates, for example, he quotes Cheney as      saying, ``They're living in the tropics. They're well fed.      They've got everything they could possibly want.''       Sands's discussion of the period preceding the second Iraq      war are particularly interesting in charting Bush's      relatively unobstructed path to war as compared with Tony      Blair's far more difficult one. Sands shows that both leaders      engaged in much dissembling and tinkering with the truth. He      describes the content of the so-called ``Downing Street      memo,'' which caused a considerable stir on both sides of the      Atlantic when it was later published in full in the London      Sunday Times and in these pages.       On March 27, 2006, The New York Times reported on another      ``extremely sensitive'' British memo describing Bush and      Blair's private two-hour meeting in the Oval Office in      January 2003, of which several highlights were first      published in the later edition of Sands's book. The sometimes      bizarre quality of these talks make one long for the      publication of the full five-page text. Bush apparently      suggested provoking a confrontation with Saddam Hussein by      painting a US surveillance plane in UN colors in the hope of      drawing Iraqi fire. The basic theme of the meeting was Bush's      determination to go to war in early March regardless of      Security Council resolutions, the findings of UN inspectors,      or anything else.       About the performance of the UN Security Council concerning      Iraq, Sands concludes:       ``The simple fact is that the great majority of states who      sat on the Security Council in March 2003 did not consider      that the circumstances, as they were then known to be, could      justify the use of force. History has shown that they were      right and that the US and Britain were wrong. No WMD have      been found. It could be said that the UN system worked. No      amount of bullying by two permanent members could buy the      votes they wanted.''       He could have added that had the inspections been allowed      to continue, war probably could have been avoided, with all      credit being given to the US for putting the necessary      pressure on Saddam Hussein. Instead, the ostensible reason      for the US invasion was changed from the alleged threat of      WMDs to regime change. Moreover, as Hans Blix reminded the      Security Council after inspectors had reached preliminary      conclusions about the absence of WMDs, ``international      inspections and monitoring systems were to stay in      place.''       Michael Byers states that the objective of his book is to      ``provide the interested non-lawyer with a readily      comprehensible overview of the law governing the use of force      in international affairs.'' Clear and informative, his      account is particularly valuable at a time when there is a      worldwide debate, arising largely from the Iraq situation--     but also relevant to the genocide in Darfur--about the      circumstances in which it is legally appropriate for one      country to use force against another or for international      intervention on humanitarian grounds.       Byers's discussion of self-defense, the justifying      condition for the unilateral use of force in the UN Charter,      takes up more than half his book. He goes back to the case of      the steamship Caroline, which was hired in 1837 by a private      militia to ferry men and supplies across the Niagara River to      support a Canadian rebellion against the British. The British      set the ship on fire and floated it over Niagara Falls, later      claiming that they did so in self-defense and that their      action was justified on political grounds. When the dispute      was finally, and amicably, settled in 1842, the American      secretary of state, Daniel Webster, conceded that the use of      force in self-defense could sometimes be justified as a      matter of necessity, but that nothing ``unreasonable or      excessive'' could be done in self-defense.       These criteria--``necessity and proportionality''--were      widely accepted as the requirements of a new international      legal right to self-defense. Byers emphasizes the importance      of this precedent as showing that a country could defend      itself without declaring war, and that peace could be      maintained even when the right to self-defense was exercised;      he traces the development of this concept up to the present      time.       The United Nations was the first international organization      to combine in its charter the three main rules for      maintaining peace: prohibition on the use of force in      international affairs (Article 2.4); a provision for the use      of force by the Security Council against threats to the peace      and acts of aggression (Chapter VII); and an exception for      the use of force by governments in self-defense (in Article      51). But the plea of self-defense, as Byers shows, can be      complex when it involves forceful action beyond a nation's      own territory.       For example, in 1976 an Air France plane with many Israeli      passengers aboard was hijacked by Palestinians and taken to      Entebbe in Uganda, where non-Jewish passengers were released.      Facing a deadline for meeting the hijackers' demand for the      release of fifty-three Palestinian terrorists, an Israeli      commando team, led by Jonathan Netanyahu, killed the      hijackers, rescued the Israeli hostages, and flew them back      to Israel. Netanyahu himself was killed. This action is      now credited as a precedent for extending the right of      self-defense to protecting nationals abroad.        In April 1993 an attempt to assassinate former President      George H. W. Bush in Kuwait was thwarted by the discovery of      a sophisticated car bomb. When Iraq's involvement in this      attempt was established, President Clinton ordered the      destruction of Saddam Hussein's Military Intelligence      Headquarters in Baghdad by twenty-three Tomahawk missiles.      The Security Council did not censure this action, although      the use of force without Council authorization was condemned      by the Arab League.       The Council did not even consider President Clinton's      response to the destruction by terrorists of the U.S.      embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when he fired seventy-nine      Tomahawk missiles at al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan      and also at a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan suspected of      making chemical weapons for terrorists. Moreover, by      authorizing the U.S.-led operation against the Taliban in      Afghanistan after September 11, the Security Council also set      a precedent for using force against a state harboring      terrorists, provided that the terrorists had previously      attacked the state concerned.       On the even more controversial question of preemptive self-     defense, Byers cites the case of Israel's 1981 attack on      Iraq's French-built Osirak nuclear reactor, which the Council      unanimously condemned as a grave breach of international law.      Byers writes that George W. Bush's policy claiming the right      of the United States to use unilateral, preemptive force--     widely considered a dangerous example that other states may      try to emulate--clearly violates the common-sense criteria of      the Caroline case for self-defense. He believes that such a      policy as Bush's, if maintained, could even serve as an      incentive to some states to try to acquire a nuclear      deterrent in self-defense. He quotes the response of the UN      Secretary-General's High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges      and Change to Bush's claim of the right of preemptive self-     defense:       ``. . . In a world full of perceived potential threats, the      risk to the global order and the norm of nonintervention on      which it continues to be based is simply too great for the      legality of unilateral preventive action, as distinct from      collectively endorsed action, to be accepted. Allowing one to      so act is to allow all.''       Byers then examines the current legal status of the      relatively recent issue of humanitarian intervention and the      obligation to protect populations in distress, even from the      actions of their own governments. One of the most important      decisions of the UN Summit Meeting of September 2005 was to      give a general, although highly qualified, approval to such      interventions. But as Byers points out, while Kofi Annan      reiterates that the ``security situation in Darfur continues      to deteriorate and the moral case for action is      overwhelming,'' the Security Council has so far agreed only      to deploying a UN peacekeeping force later this year to      take over from the existing African Union force, a move      strongly opposed by the Sudanese government. The Council      has also, as mentioned above, referred the Darfur case to      the International Criminal Court.       Byers's closing chapters on the protection of civilians and      prisoners of war, and on the various UN international      tribunals, are characterized by mounting frustration at the      US administration's contemptuous attitude toward      international law and legal institutions. Of the Bush      administration's obsessive hostility toward the recently      established International Criminal Court he writes:       ``Only the United States has actively endeavoured to      undermine the court. With troops in more than 140 countries,      a propensity to intervene under dubious legal circumstances,      and interpretations of the laws of war that sometimes differ      from those of other states, the single superpower feels      vulnerable to international mechanisms for enforcing      international criminal law. Whereas the Clinton      Administration sought to negotiate protections against the      abuse of international procedures into the statutes of the      tribunals it helped to create, the Bush Administration has      adopted an entirely hostile stance. . . .       ``Since coming to office, President Bush has `un-signed'      the ICC statute, pressured the UN Security Council into      temporarily exempting US forces from the Court's      jurisdiction, and obtained more than ninety bilateral      treaties committing individual countries not to surrender US      citizens to The Hague. Bush has even signed legislation that      authorizes him to use military force to secure the release of      any US service member detained by the ICC. The law is      popularly known as `The Hague Invasion Act.' ''       Since under the present ICC statute it is virtually      impossible that the Court would detain a US soldier, this      exceptional--even paranoid--brand of US exceptionalism can      only add to the frustration of the nations seeking a fair and      workable international legal system.       When the UN Preparatory Commission was setting up the world      organization in London in the fall of 1945, the European      colonial powers could sometimes scarcely contain their      resentment of what they saw as the self-righteous attitude of      the US delegation toward European colonialism and its      abolition. Their resentment occasionally took the form of      rather feeble allusions to the fate of American Indians; but      I cannot recall a single reference to America's many efforts      at regime change in the fairly recent past. These actions are      the subject of the first part of Overthrow, Stephen Kinzer's      wonderful chronicle of America's interventions in foreign      countries.       Kinzer describes three periods' of American intervention:      first the ``Imperial Era'' between 1893 and 1910 (in Hawaii,      the Philippines, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, and Honduras);      second, the ``Covert Action period'' between 1953 and 1973      (in Iran, Guatemala, South Vietnam, and Chile); and third,      the ``Invasions'' since 1983 (in Grenada, Panama,      Afghanistan, and Iraq). The original announced aim was to      help anti-colonial patriots to achieve success, as in Cuba      and the Philippines; and then, to the patriots' surprise,      the U.S. would establish an authoritarian protectorate.      The reasons for doing so were usually presented as      extending the advantages of American democratic principles      and protecting U.S. security. In practice, as Kinzer      shows, the principal aims were to establish the right of      U.S. business to act as it wished, to satisfy a new      national ambition for expansion, and to add to the      strength of the U.S. economy.       Kinzer quotes a letter from John L. Stevens, the American      minister in Honolulu, on January 16, 1893, to Captain Gilbert      Wiltse, the commander of the cruiser Boston. He comments,      ``Its single sentence is a dry classic of diplomatic      mendacity, full of motifs that Americans would hear often in      the century to come.'' The letter reads:       ``In view of the existing critical circumstances in      Honolulu, indicating an inadequate legal force, I request you      to land marines and sailors from the ship under your command      for the protection of the United States legation and the      United States consulate, and to secure the safety of American      life and property.''       That, effectively, was the end of the courageous Queen      Liliuokalani's resistance to the American annexation of      Hawaii.       Although there were impassioned opponents of such actions      in the United States, William James among them, Kinzer shows      that the expansionist mood of the 1890s was already producing      justifications that sound all too familiar today. American      presidents and military officers, then as now, said they were      intervening in struggles of ``good and evil'' for humanity's      sake and had God's guidance in doing so. ``The parallels      between McKinley's invasion of the Philippines and Bush's      invasion of Iraq were startling.'' Kinzer writes:       ``Both presidents sought economic as well as political      advantage for the United States. Both were also motivated by      a deep belief that the United States has a sacred mission to      spread its form of government to faraway countries. Neither      doubted that the people who lived in those countries would      welcome Americans as liberators. Neither anticipated that he      would have to fight a long counterinsurgency war to subdue      nationalist rebels. Early in the twenty-first century, ten      decades after the United States invaded the Philippines and a      few years after it invaded Iraq, those two countries were      among the most volatile and unstable in all of Asia.''       Kinzer's book is particularly enlightening about the      consequences of such unilateral interventions. He writes:       ``If it were possible to control the course of world events      by deposing foreign governments, the United States would be      unchallenged. It has deposed far more of them than any other      modern nation. The stories of what has happened in the      aftermath of these operations, however, make clear that      Americans do not know what to do with countries after      removing their leaders. They easily succumb to the temptation      to stage coups or invasions but turn quickly away when the      countries where they intervene fall into misery and      repression.''       Brushing aside fifty years of international law in the name      of the ``global war on terrorism'' is a bad idea for      everyone, including the United States. Violating global rules      undermines both America's authority and standing and its      long-term strategic interests. An already globalized and      interdependent world cannot permit a return to a situation      where each nation is entirely free to act as it wishes.       To use Sands's words, the United States, like other      countries, badly needs international agreements and      international cooperation to promote and protect its own      interests, and cooperation requires rules. The conclusion      seems plain: the United States should reengage in respecting      and developing the rule-based system that it largely      initiated after World War II and which has for many years      served it well.       Such an approach could certainly not have worse      consequences than the recent attempt to abandon the idea of      international restraint and go it alone.Some US      administrations have vigorously supported international      regulation in the past. On April 1, 2005, Secretary of State      Condoleezza Rice told the annual meeting of the American      Society of International Law that the US ``has been and will      continue to be the world's strongest voice for the      development and defense of international legal norms.'' She      added that America ``has historically been the key player in      negotiating treaties and setting up international mechanisms      for the peaceful resolution of disputes.'' As Sands comments,      ``These are important words, but they remain just that.''       A more down-to-earth perception of the situation was      expressed in May 2004 by US Senate Foreign Relations      Committee Chairman Richard Lugar, who was speaking of the      U.S. Senate's delay of some ten years in acceding to the Law      of the Sea Treaty, a delay largely caused by those Americans      who have argued that the treaty restricts the exploration and      exploitation of the seabed. Lugar      posed the question that the US has still to face:       ``If we cannot get beyond political paralysis in a case      where the coalition of American supporters is so      comprehensive, there is little reason to think that any multi      lateral solution to any international problem is likely to be      accepted within the US policy-making structure.''",1,

Gonzales will almost certainly be confirmed      as the next attorney general. With hearings on his nomination      set to start today, many Democrats think the best they can do      is wound Gonzales enough with questions about his notorious      torture memos to disqualify him for any future Supreme Court      seat. In the end, however, they will feel pressure to support      him or face retaliation from Republicans.       They should resist.       The eight Democrats and a smattering of moderate      Republicans who voted for John Ashcroft four years ago      probably felt the same pressure.       No one now can doubt the enormous power the attorney      general wields or the lasting harm the person who holds that      office can do. Gonzales may not share his predecessor's zeal      in hounding X-rated moviemakers or cancer patients who smoke      marijuana, but as the president's chief lawyer, he has been      every bit as reckless.       As a leading architect of Bush's ends-justifies-means war      on terror, Gonzales pushed to justify torturing terror      suspects in violation of international law, promoted military      tribunals that echo Stalin's show trials, helped write the      Patriot Act (which, among other powers, gives government      agents vast new snooping authority) and excused the limitless      imprisonment of American citizens whom the president merely      suspects of terror activity.       Three years into that war, much of Gonzales' handiwork has      been rejected by courts, damned by the world community and      disavowed by the administration--as in the Justice Department      memo quietly released last week declaring that ``torture is      abhorrent to both American law and values and to      international norms.''       Gonzales' defenders argue that, as White House counsel, he      was simply a passionate advocate for his client. But the most      devoted counselor knows that, even in wartime, there are      legal and moral lines this nation crosses at peril to its own      citizens and those of other countries. Gonzales'      justifications opened the door to the abuse at Abu Ghraib      prison and the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. The      mistreatment and prisoner deaths that occurred have raised      fears of retaliation against captured Americans. Those      concerns prompted a dozen retired generals and admirals,      along with civil rights groups, to oppose Gonzales'      nomination.       Our justice system relies on an attorney general willing to      defend civil liberties as ardently as he pursues criminals      and terrorists. That person must be someone who respects both      the power and the limits of law.        Gonzales' record as White House counsel is not just a      series of unfortunate missteps; rather, it is a troubling      window into the man's morality and his fitness to be the      nation's chief lawyer. Democratic senators will surely ask      Gonzales sharp and embarrassing questions about the      principles that guided his tenure in the Office of Legal      Counsel. These lawmakers then ought to demonstrate that they      understand the principles at stake by actually voting no.",,

                        ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006",OHIO,1.7668953593047017,"Washington.--The U.S. government is operating an      ``archipelago'' of prisons around the world, many of them      secret camps into which people are being ``literally      disappeared,'' a top Amnesty International official said      Sunday.       Amnesty International executive director William Schulz      criticized the administration of U.S. President George W.      Bush for holding alleged battlefield combatants in      ``indefinite incommunicado detention'' without access to      lawyers in an interview with Fox News Sunday.       Schulz was pressed to substantiate Amnesty's claim in a May      25 report that the U.S. prison camp at the Guantanamo Bay,      Cuba naval base--where hundreds of foreign terror suspects      are being held indefinitely--represents the ``gulag of our      times.''       The gulag claim, referring to the notorious prison camp      system of the Soviet Union, has drawn withering criticism      from the U.S. president, who called it ``absurd.'' Vice      President Richard Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald      Rumsfeld have also slammed the rights group's claim.       Russian 1970 Nobel Prize winner Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn      described the Soviet prison camp system in his best-selling      book ``The Gulag Archipelago.''       Schulz said the gulag reference was not ``an exact or a      literal analogy.''       ``But there are some similarities. The United States is      maintaining an archipelago of prisons around the world, many      of them secret prisons into which people are being literally      disappeared--held in indefinite incommunicado detention      without access to lawyers,'' Schulz told Fox.       Asked how AI could compare the detentions of millions of      Soviet citizens in the gulag system to purported anti-U.S.      combatants captured on the battlefield, Schulz said some of      those held in Guantanamo ``happened to be in the wrong place      at the wrong time.       ``We do know that at least some of the 200 some prisoners      who have been released from Guantanamo Bay have made pretty      persuasive cases that they were imprisoned there, not because      they were involved in military conflict but simply because      they were enemies of the Northern Alliance,'' he said.       Schulz called for an official probe into the alleged rights      abuses at U.S. detention centers around the globe.       Amnesty refers in the May 25 report to Rumsfeld and U.S.      Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as alleged ``torture      architects.''       The United States ``should be the one that should      investigate those who are alleged at least to be architects      of torture, not just the foot soldiers who may have inflicted      the torture directly, but those who authorized it or      encouraged it or provided rationales for it,'' Schulz said.       According to Amnesty, Rumsfeld provided ``the exact rules,      27 of them in fact, for interrogations, some of which do      constitute torture or cruel, inhumane treatment,'' Schulz      said.       The Guantanamo Bay camp and U.S. detention practices have      been the subject of renewed debate in recent weeks, sparked      by a Newsweek magazine report--since retracted--that      Guantanamo interrogators flushed a Koran in a toilet to      rattle Muslim prisoners.       Amnesty is not the only rights group to have called on      Washington to investigate alleged abuses at the camp--Schulz      pointed to released FBI documents that also raised concerns      about Guantanamo interrogations.       U.S. officials insist such concerns are unfounded, and that      the ``war on terror'' detainees are treated as humanely as      possible.       U.S. soldiers have been tried and punished for abusing      detainees--notably at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison, where at      least one captive died--but U.S. officials say those are      isolated incidents.       The furor sparked by Amnesty's claims shows no signs of      abating.       The New York Times said Sunday that the Guantanamo Bay      prison should be closed down, saying it had become ``a      national shame'' and a ``propaganda gift to America's      enemies.''       ``What makes Amnesty's gulag metaphor apt is that      Guantanamo is merely one of a chain of shadowy detention      camps that also includes Abu Ghraib in Iraq, the military      prison at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and other, secret      locations run by the intelligence agencies,'' the Times said.       The Washington Post, whose editorial page has been more      critical of Amnesty's gulag claim, reported Sunday--citing      Schulz--that Amnesty's donations have quintupled and new      memberships have doubled in the past week since it released      its report.

An      investigation led by Major General Antonio Taguba, reported      widespread abuses in the detention of Iraqi prisoners      including incidents in which detainees were threatened with a      pistol and with military dogs, prisoners were being sodomized      with a chemical light and broomstick and soldiers were      forcing naked prisoners into compromising positions. Members      of Congress were never told the true extent of the abuses      taking place; instead we were left to find out the truth when      it was revealed to the general public. It is inconceivable      that Secretary Rumsfeld would leave both the Executive and      Legislative branches of our government in the dark regarding      a critical foreign policy issue. His actions clearly go      against the dictates and procedures of his position as      Secretary of Defense.       Secretary Rumsfeld's failures in managing the war in Iraq      go beyond the abuses of Iraqi prisoners. It has become clear      that he has no control over the thousands of private      contractors and private security companies in Iraq. In fact,      the Pentagon has no records as to the number of private      individuals who are in Iraq working on behalf of the United      States Government. In addition to the extreme danger many of      these individuals are being placed in, there are numerous      reports that many of these individuals are taking part in      highly illegal activities. Indeed, privately contracted      individuals are suspected as being involved with the abuses      that took place in the Abu Ghraib prison. Another disturbing      issue that is just now coming to light is that there are      currently fourteen different investigations into prisoner      deaths that took place in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet another      indication that Secretary Rumsfeld has known about the severe      mistreatment of prisoners and has failed to act.       The severity of Secretary Rumsfeld's actions pose grave      consequences for our Nation. Let me be clear, I have always      supported the men and women of our Armed Forces. It is my      belief that the abuse of prisoners in Iraq has been the work      of a small number of disgraceful American soldiers. However,      as the Secretary of Defense, he bears the burden of the      actions of the Armed Forces that he was sworn to oversee. The      grotesque images of U.S. soldiers abusing      Iraqi prisoners are being shown around the world and no      amount of words can change the effect of those images. In the      short term our soldiers abroad now face even greater danger      in fighting this war. In the long term our Nation now must      address the outlook for our war in Iraq that only seems to      become more difficult by the day. As the Secretary of      Defense, your leadership should help guide our Armed Forces      to victory, instead your tenure as Secretary has brought      disrepute and a greater burden upon our Nation.       In conclusion, it is absolutely essential that the entire      United States Congress get involved in the investigation of      these atrocities because it affects each and every one of us      as we represent constituents who currently serve in Iraq.

Lynndie England will be convicted for      her role in abusing and humiliating Iraqi prisoners at the      infamous Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.       Anyone tempted to shed tears over the prospect of the young      Army reservist spending time behind bars need only remember      the photographs that showed England leering as she pointed to      the genitals of a male captive, and as she led a naked      prisoner around by a leash.       These images shamed both U.S. critics and supporters of the      U.S. invasion. They also had a devastating impact on American      efforts to win support in Iraq and throughout the Middle East      for the occupation and democratization of Iraq.       It was neither surprising nor upsetting then to learn      Friday that the government plans to file new charges against      England, whose guilty plea was tossed out and her court      martial canceled earlier in the week. A military judge, Col.      James Pohl, declared a mistrial after Pvt. Charles A. Graner      Jr., a former guard at Abu Ghraib, testified that the photos      were taken for training purposes. That testimony undermined      England's admission that she knew her actions were wrong and      her acceptance of responsibility.       But England and the the few other enlisted men and women      who have faced courts martial in the scandal should not be      the only ones to pay a price for what happened at Abu Ghraib.      High-level military and administration officials must not be      allowed to escape responsibility for a scandal that is far      more of their making than of low-ranking soldiers. So far,      Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, an Army reservist who formerly      ran U.S. prisons in Iraq, is the only high-level officer to      be disciplined, and she rightly regards herself as a      scapegoat.       Congress, which abandoned its oversight role during the      invasion and its bloody aftermath, should demand an      investigation by a bipartisan independent commission similar      to the Sept. 11 commission.       Instead of starting at the bottom, as the military's      whitewashes have done, the panel should start at the top with      Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who failed to plan for      postwar Iraq and then failed to adjust his plans after the      insurgency began. Rumsfeld is the reason why there were      insufficient numbers of prison guards in Iraq and why they      had inadequate training and murky guidelines. Rumsfeld also      made the decision to authorize harsh interrogation techniques      for detainees at Guantanamo Bay and then to apply those      methods in Iraq.       Next on the list should be Attorney General Alberto      Gonzales, who three years ago prepared a legal opinion      stating that Geneva Conventions protections for detainees in      Afghanistan were ``obsolete.'' That opinion, along with his      endorsement of the harsh interrogation methods, contributed      to the abuses at Abu Ghraib. Also high on the list should be      Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the former commander of U.S. forces      in Iraq, who cleared the use of interrogation techniques in      Iraq that violated Geneva Conventions.       The judge in England's case dismissed charges against her      because of testimony indicating others were to blame. England      should face justice. But the civilian and military leaders      who sent her to Iraq and who bear larger responsibility for      the illegal and immoral abuses that occurred there should be      held accountable as well.",1,

The other six Iraqis were equally effusive, their      appreciation undimmed by the current prisoner abuse scandal      at Abu Ghraib, outside Baghdad, and other occupation worries      back home.       ``We have freedom in Iraq. Now we say anything we want,''      Zinad said. ``Under Saddam we whispered.''       In recent interviews, the seven Iraqis were unflagging in      their confidence about Iraq's future and the U.S. role in it.       Zinad on the prisoner abuse: ``Some American soldiers are a      problem. Not all Americans. These Americans who did this will      be punished. Under Saddam, such abuses were rewarded and      praised. Iraqis understand the difference.''       Qasim Kadhim on Americans who think the invasion of Iraq      was a mistake: ``I think those people have made a mistake,      because under Allah, all people are brothers. We must help      each other if we have a problem. . . . How do we do it if      nobody helps us?''       Basim Al Fadhly on why many Iraqis are angry: ``They have      good reasons to be angry. There have been many mistakes      because of cultural differences. Iraq is not a country      like America yet. We were 35 years under Saddam. But that      does not mean Iraqis don't want democracy. People like      freedom, but with freedom you need life.''       The seven have become celebrities in Houston as they learn      how to use their artificial limbs and soak up a bit of Texas      hospitality when not at the hospital. They've watched an      Astros game in the owner's box, donned cowboy duds for a      barbecue at the historic Y.O. Ranch, even spent a night at      the dog track.       This week, they make a pilgrimage to Washington to employ      their new limbs shaking the hands of more Americans they want      to thank, including soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical      Center who have undergone amputations. They also plan to lay      a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.       ``Saddam is the past,'' Kadhim said. ``Now we must make      business contacts in America.''",,

Sadly much of it has come as a result of the response to the      terrorists attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon      on Sept. 11, 2001. What makes that sad is that an outside      attack should have--and did for a brief time--brought the      country closer together.       That has been fractured by political opportunists who      responded to the attacks with legislation that Americans      would never have accepted before their confidence was rattled      so vehemently.       One such piece of legislation is the provocatively named      USA Patriot Act. The Patriot legislation was drafted to give      the government a way to fight terrorism. No one would argue      that's an important and necessary goal.       But it contains too many provisions that we find      unacceptable despite the fact that we remain staunchly anti-     terrorist and pro-America. (We're cutting off that argument      at the pass . . .)       The scariest provision is one that allows the government to      get warrants that would allow them to find out what books      someone is reading or checking out of the library.       That's un-American enough in a society that prides itself      on the free and open exchange of ideas. What's worse is that      we wouldn't know what books or articles are on that list that      makes a reader a suspect.       To make it scarier, those warrants are requested and      granted in secret.       We know that there are armchair generals who are rushing to      point out that this is the kind of action needed to fight      enemies like terrorists. We remain unconvinced that such      secret warrants would make us much different or better than      nations that support terrorists.       Nor can we justify giving a tool like this to the federal      government under an administration that can't convince its      people or the world that it's not engaging in torture. We      suspect there will be more Abu Ghraibs before the War on      Terror is finished.       So what makes somebody a patriot? How about standing up      against faulty legislation even when a nation that's still in      fear may support that law? Maybe it's recognizing the lessons      of history and trying to protect our country from another      shameful incident like the imprisonment of Japanese citizens      during World War II?       That's exactly what Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking      Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, is doing by      refusing to sign a version of the Patriot Act that would      extend these powers for four years.

Many others have met a different fate. Put it      this way, they're no longer a problem to the United States      and our friends and allies. (President George W. Bush, State      of the Union Address, February 4, 2003)       In April, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in      the cases of Jose Padilla and Yaser Hamdi--both U.S. citizens      who have been held in military detention facilities for more      than two years. One justice wondered aloud how the Court      could be sure that government interrogators were not abusing      these detainees. You just have to ``trust the executive to      make the kind of quintessential military judgments that are      involved in things like that,'' said Deputy Solicitor General      Paul Clement! Later that evening, CBS's 60 Minutes broadcast      the first shocking photographs of U.S. troops torturing Iraqi      prisoners at the Abu Ghraib detention center in Iraq.       The photos from Abu Ghraib have made a policy of ``trust      us'' obsolete. But they are only the most visible symptoms of      a much larger and more disturbing systemic illness. Since the      attacks of September 11, the United States has established a      network of detention facilities around the world used to      detain thousands of individuals captured in the ``war on      terrorism.'' Information about this system--particularly the      location of U.S. detention facilities, how many are held      within them, on what legal basis they are held, and who has      access to the prisoners--emerges in a piecemeal way, if at      all, and then largely as a result of the work of      investigative reporters and other non-governmental sources.      The official secrecy surrounding U.S. practices has made      conditions ripe for illegality and abuse.       Several of these facilities, including the U.S. military      bases at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and at Bagram Air Force Base      in Afghanistan, are well known. The existence of these      facilities--and the fact of unlawful conduct within them--     have been widely publicized and well documented. Nonetheless,      there is still no or only conflicting information about how      many individuals are held there, troubling information about      inadequate provision of notice to families about the fact of      detainees' capture and condition, and unclear or conflicting      statements about detainees' legal status and rights. While      the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has      visited these facilities, their visits have been undermined      in ways contrary to the letter and spirit of binding law.       In addition, there are detention facilities that multiple      sources have reported are maintained by the United States in      various officially undisclosed locations, including      facilities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Jordan, on the      British possession of Diego Garcia, and on U.S. war ships at      sea. U.S. Government officials have alluded to detention      facilities in undisclosed locations, declining to deny their      existence or refusing to comment on reports of their      existence.\3\ A Department of Defense official told Human      Rights First in June 2004 that while Abu Ghraib and      Guantanamo's Camp Echo were open to discussion, ``as a matter      of policy, we don't comment on other facilities.\4\      Similarly, Captain Bruce Frame, a U.S. army spokesman from      CENTCOM, the unified military command that covers Africa, the      Middle East, and Central Asia, told Human Rights First only      that there ``may or may not'' be detention centers in      countries other than Iraq and Afghanistan in CENTCOM's area      of responsibility.\5\",1,

What we always find out is it is the lower lights, the corporals and the sergeants who are the ones being tried and convicted. Those in the higher ranks are not.

The president wants to stay not      within the letter of the law, but within its broad      principles, and in the last resort, ``military necessity''      can overrule all of it. According to his legal counsel at the      time, Alberto R. Gonzales, the President's warmaking powers      gave him ultimate constitutional authority to ignore any      relevant laws in the conduct of the conflict. Sticking to the      Geneva Convention was the exclusive prerogative of one man,      George W. Bush; and he could, if he wished, make exceptions.      As Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee argues in another memo, ``Any effort to apply Section 2340A in a manner that interferes with the President's direction of such core war matters as the detention and interrogation of enemy combatants thus would be unconstitutional. (Section 2340A refers to the United States law that incorporates the international Convention Against Torture.)       Bybee asserted that the president was within his legal      rights to permit his military surrogates to inflict ``cruel,      inhuman or degrading'' treatment on prisoners without      violating strictures against torture. For an act of abuse to      be considered torture, the abuser must be inflicting pain      ``of such a high level intensity that the pain is difficult      for the subject to endure.'' If the abuser is doing this to      get information and not merely for sadistic enjoyment, then      ``even if the defendant knows that severe pain will result      from his actions,'' he's not guilty of torture. Threatening      to kill a prisoner is not torture; ``the threat must indicate      that the death is `imminent.' '' Beating prisoners is not      torture either. Bybee argues that a case of kicking an inmate      in the stomach with military boots while the prisoner is in a      kneeling position does not by itself rise to the level of      torture.       Bybee even suggests that full-fledged torture of inmates      might be legal because it could be construed as ``self-     defense,'' on the grounds that ``the threat of an impending      terrorist attack threatens the lives of hundreds if not      thousands of American citizens.'' By that reasoning, torture      could be justified almost anywhere on the battlefield of the      war on terror. Only the president's discretion forbade it.      These guidelines were formally repudiated by the      administration the week before Gonzales's appearance before      the Senate Judiciary Committee for confirmation as attorney      general.       In this context, Secretary Rumsfeld's decision to take the      gloves off in Guantanamo for six weeks makes more sense. The      use of dogs to intimidate prisoners and the use of nudity for      humiliation were now allowed. Although abuse was specifically      employed in only two cases before Rumsfeld rescinded the      order, practical precedents had been set; and the broader      mixed message sent from the White House clearly reached      commanders in the field. Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, in      charge of the Iraq counterinsurgency, also sent out several      conflicting memos with regard to the treatment of prisoners--     memos that only added to the confusion as to what was      permitted and what wasn't. When the general in charge of      Guantanamo was sent to Abu Ghraib to help intelligence      gathering, the ``migration'' of techniques (the term used in      the Pentagon's Schlesinger Report) from those reserved for      extreme cases in the leadership of Al Qaeda to thousands of      Iraqi civilians, most of whom, according to the intelligence      sources, were innocent of any crime at all, was complete.      Again, there is no evidence of anyone at a high level      directly mandating torture or abuse, except in the two cases      at Gitmo. But there is growing evidence recently uncovered by      the ACLU . . . that authorities in the FBI and elsewhere were      aware of abuses and did little to prevent or stop them.",1,

Guantanamo Bay. Practices and places that have become      synonymous with the abuse of detainees in U.S. custody are      getting renewed attention at the United Nations this week,      where the UN Committee Against Torture is holding hearings on      U.S. compliance with its international obligations. But there      is one name expected to arise this week that few people in      this country will have heard about--and it's the one that's      closest to home.       It's called Area 2. And for nearly two decades beginning in      1971, it was the epicenter for what has been described as the      systematic torture of dozens of African-American males by      Chicago police officers. In total, more than 135 people say      they were subjected to abuse including having guns forced      into their mouths, bags placed over their heads, and electric      shocks inflicted to their genitals. Four men have been      released from death row after government investigators      concluded torture led to their wrongful convictions.       Yet the case around Area 2 is nowhere near a resolution--to      date, not one Chicago police officer has been charged with      any crime.       The most prominent officer, former police commander Jon      Burge, was dismissed in the early 1990s. He retired to      Florida where he continues to collect a pension. Today, a      special prosecutor is now in the fourth year of an      investigation. Just last week, a group of Chicago police      officers won a court ruling to delay the release of the      prosecutor's preliminary report.       David Bates, one of dozens of men to come forward with      allegations of abuse at the hands of the Chicago police.       Flint Taylor, an attorney with the People's Law Office in      Chicago, which he helped found in the late 1960s. He has      represented many of the torture victims and was directly      involved in spearheading the special prosecutor's      investigation.       John Conroy a journalist and author who has covered the      case for over a decade. He has written several articles for      the Chicago Reader, and is the author of the book      ``Unspeakable Acts, Ordinary People: The Dynamics of      Torture.''       Amy Goodman. We go now to Chicago, where we're joined by      three guests: David Bates, Flint Taylor and John Conroy.      David Bates is one of dozens of men to come forward with      allegations of abuse at the hands of the Chicago police.      Flint Taylor is an attorney with the People's Law Office in      Chicago, which he helped found in the late 1960s. He has      represented many of the torture victims and was directly      involved in spearheading the special prosecutor's      investigation. And John Conroy is a journalist and author      who's covered the case for over a decade. He's written      several articles for the Chicago Reader and is the author of      the book, Unspeakable Acts, Ordinary People: The Dynamics of      Torture. We welcome you all to Democracy Now! I want to begin      with Flint Taylor for an overview. You have been working on      this case for years. You have represented people who said      they were tortured. Give us the scope of this story.       Flint Taylor. Well, the scope started out with one man who      was tortured by electric shock and having a plastic bag put      over his head and being beaten by Jon Burge and others at the      Area 2 police station. He, on his own, brought a lawsuit in      the mid-`80s. That lawsuit, we got involved in, and over the      years we were able to uncover, with the help of journalists      such as John Conroy, others such as David Bates, who had also      been tortured and had told their stories in various courts,      but no one had put all this evidence together.       We were able to assimilate, over many years, over 60 cases      of torture, and when I say ``torture,'' I mean electric      shock, I mean suffocation with bags, I mean mock executions,      I mean racial attacks, that kind of thing. And they were all      coming out of the same station, and they were all headed up      by this man, Jon Burge, who came out of Vietnam, started out      as a detective and quickly rose in the ranks through      sergeant, lieutenant and commander. This went on--the actual      documentation now shows that this went on for over 20 years,      from 1972 to 1992, when in fact Burge was finally, after      community outrage, suspended and fired from his job.       As you said, he has never been prosecuted. The State's      Attorney of Cook County at the time this evidence first came      to light in the mid- `80s was none other than the now major      Richard Daley. The Superintendent of Police at that time      contacted him with the evidence of torture and said, ``Are      you going to prosecute this?'' Daley did not intervene or      prosecute at that time. Later on, his first assistant,      Richard Devine, became State's Attorney of Cook County.      Remarkably, Devine, while he was in private practice, had      been Burge's lawyer, defending many of these civil cases. He      then became prosecutor in 1997. Of course, he did nothing      either, because his clients were the ones that needed      to be investigated. So for 20, 25, 30 years, no one in the      prosecutor's office, the current mayor or the current state's      attorney, no one else did any investigation.       Finally, the community outrage was so strong with regard to      all of that that a special prosecutor was appointed. That was      four years ago, as you said. Four years of investigation has      led to his publicly saying that he now has 192 cases of      torture and abuse at Area 2 and later at the Area 3 station,      where Burge was transferred to later on. He now is talking      about releasing a report. He still is not talking about      indicting anybody. The rumor has it that, because it is so      long, that we're going to have a catch-22 situation, and      we're going to have the statute of limitations invoked by the      special prosecutor, who's going to release a report but say      it's too late to indict anybody.       Of course, we all say that that's ridiculous, that there      are ongoing conspiracy allegations and evidence that there's      an obstruction of justice going on in the various courts.      There's perjury going on. So, no one's going to be satisfied      if, in fact, all that happens is a report, no matter how      damning the report may be. So the struggle here in Chicago      continues and will continue, as long as people are still in      jail because of the confessions that were tortured from them,      and as long as Burge and others sit in Florida and other      places and collect hundreds of thousands and even millions of      dollars in police pensions, rather than to face criminal      charges, whether they be state charges, federal charges or      charges before the International Court of Justice.       Amy Goodman. We are also joined by David Bates. Can you      tell us what happened to you? When did it happen? Tell us the      whole course of events.       David Bates. Well, I believe it was October the 28th or      29th of 1983, when a few officers knocked on my mom's door      and announced that they were police officers and let my mom      know that I'll be taken away and that I'll be coming home      shortly. There were supposed to be some questions regarding a      case. Of course, I got to the police station. I was      questioned. I let the officers or detectives know that I had      nothing to do with the case. I knew nothing. This went on for      two days.       At that time, it was five sessions of torture, starting      with two with slaps and kicks and threats. It was two      particular sessions of torture that was very devastating, in      which a plastic bag was placed over my head. I was punched      and kicked. And I'll tell you, when you talk about torture,      you're talking about individuals who, most part, were young,      had a few brushes with the law, but never in a million years      thought that they would have a plastic bag placed over their      head.       More importantly, the torture has never been resolved. No      one has ever owned up to the torture. So we have hundreds of      individuals who have psychologically been warped, been      destroyed. There's never been any clinical resolution to the      torture. No one has owned up to it.       And I tell you, the fact that this attorney and this      journalist have spent years trying to uncover the truth and      community organizations and individuals--we're talking about      a city. We're talking about a state. We're talking about      legislators, who have not looked into the issue of torture,      and I say it's a shame. And I would like to commend these      gentlemen for working hard to bring the issue of torture out.      But I say it's time for the legislators and mayor and      individuals who had firsthand knowledge of it to come clean      with it and bring these individuals to justice.       Amy Goodman. Flint Taylor, I remember years ago with an      especially active group of mothers, mothers in Chicago of men      on death row, who kept raising the issue of this police      commander, Burge, and saying that their sons had been      tortured, that one had engraved in a metal bench in the      police station, ``I am tortured, I'm forced to confess,''      something like that. What about this? What about death row      cases, where men ended up on death row?       Flint Taylor. That's been a major, major piece of this      whole struggle against police torture. In the early and mid-     `90s, the movement against police torture and for human      rights came together with the anti-death penalty movement      here in Chicago and raised a very strong set of voices,      some of whom you've just mentioned. For people, there were      at least ten to twelve people on death row here in      Illinois who alleged and had evidence to show that Burge      and his men had tortured them into giving confessions, one      of whom was Aaron Patterson, whom you just mentioned, who      during a break in one of his torture sessions etched in a      bench that he had been suffocated with a bag and was being      tortured. That later came out.       Ultimately, due to the combination of the factors, and      articles that John wrote, and speaking out by David and      others in the community, and the work of various lawyers,      Governor Ryan looked at all of these cases, and as you know,      he not only commuted the sentence of all of those on death      row, some 160-odd people, but he looked specifically at four      cases of torture by Burge and others and found that those      individuals were innocent, that they had been tortured into      giving false confession, and he gave full innocence pardons      to those four individuals. That's Aaron Patterson, Stanley      Howard, Madison Hobley and Leroy Orange.       Those four men are now ``fortunate'' enough--and I put that      with quotes around it--to be able to, because they've been      exonerated, bring lawsuits in federal courts. So there is not      only the special prosecutor, but there are these lawsuits by      the individuals who have been pardoned in federal court,      where we are fighting the issues of torture and bringing out      evidence in that forum, as well.       And there's an obstruction of justice going on in that      courtroom, as well as against the special prosecutor, as the      city has paid over $5 million to a set of private lawyers to      represent the police officers, including Burge, in all these      cases. Burge now and his men--and there's now over 50      detectives that are named in one or more of these 192 cases--     they are all getting free lawyers, and they're getting the      advice from the city-paid lawyers to take the Fifth      Amendment. So you now have the spectacle of, in these federal      cases and in front of the special prosecutor, that former and      present law enforcement officers, rather than to answer      questions about whether they tortured and abused people like      David Bates and the men on death row, they have all lined up      and taken the Fifth Amendment as to each and every allegation      of police torture.       Amy Goodman. John Conroy, you're a journalist and author.      You've covered the torture case for over a decade for the      Chicago Reader, and you wrote the book, ``Unspeakable Acts,      Ordinary People: The Dynamics of Torture.'' How has this      taken so long to come out, though it has come out in parts      over the years and in certain communities well-known? And now      the question of whether, in fact, it will be released, this      report that among other people calling for this, four black      aldermen are calling for the public release of this report.       John Conroy. Well, it hasn't taken that long to be out. It      was out in 1990, when we did the story in the Chicago Reader,      the first story, and we've done more than 100,000 words      since. And I think that what's dragged on--the reason why      it's dragged on--I differ with the estimable Mr. Taylor here      on this--is that there is no community outrage. People don't      care. As in every society in which people are tortured,      there's a torture book class in Chicago. It's African      American men, most of them with criminal records. And they're      just beyond the pale of our compassion. We just don't care.       And that's why it's taken 15 years for you probably to do      this program and many others now interested in this report,      when the information has been out there for a very long time.      The New York Times, I think, it's covered this twice: once,      when the men were pardoned; and once, when there was a float      in the St. Patrick's Day parade that was going to honor four      of the officers who had been accused, and the float never      came to be in the parade, but there was a controversy      about it. So, that shows you, I think, the level of      concern in the United States about this issue.       Amy Goodman. We are talking to John Conroy, author of      Unspeakable Acts, Ordinary People: The Dynamics of Torture.      We're also joined by David Bates, a torture victim, and Flint      Taylor, an attorney who has worked on this case for decades.       Amy Goodman. Our guests in the Chicago studio are John      Conroy, who is a journalist and author, covered the torture      case for over a decade for the Chicago Reader, author of      Unspeakable Acts, Ordinary People: The Dynamics of Torture;      David Bates is also with us, as is Flint Taylor, attorney      with the People's Law Office in Chicago. David Bates, are you      going to sue the police department?       David Bates. Well, I have to consult with my attorneys      regarding that. I'll just have to say that in conjunction      with what Flint said and John, this has been going on for so      long, and there hasn't been the outrage needed to bring      attention to the torture in order to get those convictions.      But, again, I just want to commend individuals who have been      tirelessly working to keep this issue of torture in the news.      We have to look at this from a human perspective. These are      individuals who were tortured and beaten at the hands of      people who basically are supposed to serve and protect them.      And imagine keeping this thing and not being able to talk to      people about this. A lot of these gentlemen went to prison      and served long stints of time incarcerated. There was no one      to talk to about the torture. Even contact with public      officials or community leaders, it was no one to talk to      about it. And, again, I just want to commend everybody for      coming on board with this issue. But there's a lot need to be      done.       Amy Goodman. David Bates, did you hear about this happening      to other people at the time that this happened to you?       David Bates. Well, see, the problem comes in, is that when      you're in prison and you're in an environment like that, you      do not want to let anyone know that you made a confession,      whether you were tortured, whatever--however you made the      confession, it was not in your best interest to expose that      while you were in prison. You would be considered weak. So,      imagine these individuals in prison not able to even seek      legal help and advice. I liken it to being raped, honestly.      Individuals not able to be--go for help. Then, when you did      go for help, when you had the opportunity to go for help,      people said it didn't happen. So, I tell you, when you get      rid of all--when you get down to the human aspect of this      problem, you're going to deal with a lot of sick men, a lot      of sick men that need clinical-- some type of clinical help      to deal with the torture.       Amy Goodman. David Bates, when you saw the pictures at Abu      Ghraib, what were your thoughts?        David Bates. Well, the pictures, I'll say this. My thoughts      on the whole process was: how the hell did they get hearings,      and torture from anywhere is wrong. But as we've spoke on,      this torture has taken place for over two to three decades in      America, on the Southside of Chicago. Why didn't we have      public hearings? Why didn't the state legislators come in and      do investigations? We actually had to go outside the country      to an international court to deal with police torture. On      October the 14th, the People's Law Office and other attorneys      met in front of the Organization of American States to bring      attention to the issue of torture, and we're looking for      delegation of individuals to come in and to ask Mayor Daley      questions that he hasn't been able to answer to the public      since this Jon Burge stuff has been going on. And I tell you,      it's going to be an embarrassment to a lot of people, but      like my good friend Conroy said, they've been knowing      about it.       Amy Goodman. Let me ask about the knowledge to the very      top. Some are saying--and I want to put this question to      Flint Taylor, attorney with the People's Law Office in      Chicago--that the report could well implicate, as you were      talking about, the State's Attorney, Richard Daley, his      assistant Richard Devine, who now holds the top job. Can you      talk more about how they knew, the whole issue of them being      told early on?       Flint Taylor. Well, as I said, Richard Daley was previously      the State's Attorney of Cook County. In 1982, when one of the      major--the first major case broke with regard to police      torture, the Andrew Wilson case, the superintendent of police      was informed by the head of the hospital, the prison hospital      where Andrew Wilson was being held, that there was serious      evidence of torture, that Andrew Wilson not only said, but      had physical evidence that supported the conclusion that he      had been tortured by electric shock, by beating, and he had      15 injuries all over him, burns and everything like that. And      the head of the hospital was so shocked, he brought it      straight to the superintendent of police.       The superintendent of police then brought it straight to      Richard Daley. He knew that Andrew Wilson had been charged      with very serious offenses, shooting two police officers and      killing them. So Daley decided that rather than to      investigate the criminal activities of Jon Burge in torturing      Andrew Wilson, that that would, in fact, undercut and      undermine, he thought, the prosecution of Wilson, so he did      nothing. He did no prosecution at that time.       He then presided over the next eight years over the State's      Attorney's office, which was complicit in taking over 55      confessions from 55 different victims of Burge and police      torture. In all of those or many of those cases in the      individual courts, there was testimony from those victims      that they had been tortured. However, Daley defended all      those cases, put all those people behind bars, many of them      on death row, and in no instance did he investigate the      continuing allegations that were coming out of Burge's police      headquarters that people were tortured. Daley then went on to      be the mayor of the City of Chicago.       There was--and John and I disagree in the sense that there      had been at times public outrage. The public outrage reaches      certain proportions at different times. We're at one those      key points again today. We had been in the early '90s. And      one the reasons for that was this Andrew Wilson trial that      brought out all this evidence and put together all these      different allegations of torture. Because of all of that, the      police department was forced to reinvestigate. This was in      the early 1990s.       They put an honest investigator in charge of the      investigation, and lo and behold, he came to an obvious      conclusion. He said there was systematic torture at Area 2.      He said he had looked at 50 cases, and there was systematic      torture. Well, what did the superintendent of police do? He      suppressed that report. He then met with the mayor of the      City of Chicago, after we had gotten that report released by      a judge, and he and the mayor, who is now Richard Daley,      instead of saying, ``Now we have the evidence to prosecute.      Now we should proceed. Now we should lock Burge up,'' what      did they do? They not only attempted to suppress the report,      but then they went publicly and discredited it. Daley stepped      forward and said, ``These are only rumors and innuendo.'' So,      at every point, as I've mentioned, Daley, rather than taking      his responsibility as chief law enforcement officer and chief      executive officer of the City of Chicago, moved to suppress      and to do nothing.       Amy Goodman. Legally--let me ask you, Flint Taylor.      Legally, if crimes are known about, and they are covered up,      is Mayor Daley criminally liable?       Flint Taylor: Well, at this point, is he criminally liable?      I suppose you could see him a co-conspirator, in that it was      certain obstruction of justice over the years, certainly. But      I think at this point what we're looking for is if a special      prosecutor comes out with a report and says, ``I can't      indict, because it's too late,'' then the people of the City      of Chicago have to look in two directions. They have to look      backwards to Daley and Devine and say, ``Well, the special      prosecutor was hamstrung by the fact that Daley and Devine      didn't act when they should have,'' and then we have to look      forward and say, ``That's not sufficient. That's not right.''       There are continuing criminal violations here, and if the      special prosecutor won't do anything about them, then      Fitzgerald, who is the U.S. Attorney here and who, of course,      has made his name in the Valerie Plame case and has already      indicted Daley's people in a wide-ranging truck scandal, he      has to open his investigation into federal RICO or      racketeering charges, as well as obstruction of justice and      perjury. And as David has mentioned, it has been taken to the      international forum, not only last fall to the Inter-American      Commission on Human Rights, which is the Organization of      American States, who is still looking into this issue, but      this past week and right now, it's been presented to the      Committee Against Torture of the United Nations in Geneva,      and one of our people has spoken with and presented evidence      to the Committee Against Torture, and that committee has      ordered the government to respond and to speak to the issues      of torture here in this country. And in its concluding      remarks, it put with Abu Ghraib and put with Guantanamo the      situation of Chicago.       And so, perhaps there's not enough public outrage here, but      the international community is looking at it in a very strong      way, and to hear Chicago put in the same breath with      Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib is something that--if that doesn't      wake up the powers that be here in the City of Chicago and      that doesn't wake up the U.S. Attorney's office and that      doesn't, in fact, put on the carpet the State's Attorney of      Cook County and the Mayor of the City of Chicago, I don't      know what will.       Amy Goodman: John Conroy, the Midwest Coalition for Human      Rights will present a report that includes the Chicago      torture allegations to the U.N. Human Rights Commission. How      significant is this? And, finally, why do you call your book      ``Unspeakable Acts, Ordinary People''?       John Conroy: Well, let me take the second question first. I      call the book ``Unspeakable Acts, Ordinary People,'' because      torture is always done by--we want our torturers to be      monsters, but it turns out that they're just ordinary people      like you and me. And I can go back and cite you all kinds of      psychological experiments in which they have found that      people will do extraordinary things, inflicting pain on other      people, if they are simply ordered to do so, simply following      orders someone else is taking responsibility. And it doesn't      require any sort of a twisted mind to do this. We are all--     most of us are given to obedience. And so, I've interviewed      torturers from around the world, former torturers, and they      all struck me as very ordinary men.       How significant the international attention will be remains      to be seen. It's a unique turn, and it's somewhat thrilling,      I think, for those of us who have been watching this for a      long time to see it finally raise to the level of being      mentioned in a phrase with Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo. But      whether this will just be one of those media--you know, where      the media comes in for a day or two and then leaves remains      to be seen.       Amy Goodman: And what's the timetable on this?       John Conroy: The special prosecutor is supposed to--I'm      sorry. The judge who oversees the prosecutor is supposed to      rule, I believe, on the 12th of May, as to whether the report      will be released or not.       Amy Goodman: That will be Friday, and we will certainly      follow it up. I want to thank you all for being with us:      David Bates, torture victim himself, telling his own story;      Flint Taylor, attorney with the People's Law Office in      Chicago, who has represented many of the victims; and John      Conroy, who has written about this for years for the Chicago      Reader, author of ``Unspeakable Acts, Ordinary People: The      Dynamics of Torture.''",1,

Rumsfeld's decision embittered the      American intelligence community, damaged the effectiveness of      elite combat units, and hurt America's prospects in the war      on terror.       According to interviews with several past and present      American intelligence officials, the Pentagon's operation,      known inside the intelligence community by several code      words, including Copper Green, encouraged physical coercion      and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners in an effort to      generate more intelligence about the growing insurgency in      Iraq. A senior C.I.A. official, in confirming the details of      this account last week, said that the operation stemmed from      Rumsfeld's long-standing desire to wrest control of America's      clandestine and paramilitary operations from the C.I.A.       Rumsfeld, during appearances last week before Congress to      testify about Abu Ghraib, was precluded by law from      explicitly mentioning highly secret matters in an      unclassified session. But he conveyed the message that he was      telling the public all that he knew about the story. He said,      ``Any suggestion that there is not a full, deep awareness of      what has happened, and the damage it has done, I think, would      be a misunderstanding.'' The senior C.I.A. official, asked      about Rumsfeld's testimony and that of Stephen Cambone, his      Under-Secretary for Intelligence, said, ``Some people think      you can bullshit anyone.''       The Abu Ghraib story began, in a sense, just weeks after      the September 11, 2001, attacks, with the American bombing of      Afghanistan. Almost from the start, the Administration's      search for Al Qaeda members in the war zone, and its      worldwide search for terrorists, came up against major      command-and-control problems. For example, combat forces that      had Al Qaeda targets in sight had to obtain legal clearance      before firing on them. On October 7th, the night the bombing      began, an unmanned Predator aircraft tracked an automobile      convoy that, American intelligence believed, contained Mullah      Mohammad Omar, the Taliban leader. A lawyer on duty at the      United States Central Command headquarters, in Tampa,      Florida, refused to authorize a strike. By the time an attack      was approved, the target was out of reach. Rumsfeld was      apoplectic over what he saw as a self-defeating hesitation to      attack that was due to political correctness. One officer      described him to me that fall as ``kicking a lot of glass and      breaking doors.'' In November, the Washington Post reported      that, as many as ten times since early October, Air Force      pilots believed they'd had senior Al Qaeda and Taliban      members in their sights but had been unable to act in time      because of legalistic hurdles. There were similar problems      throughout the world, as American Special Forces units      seeking to move quickly against suspected terrorist cells      were compelled to get prior approval from local American      ambassadors and brief their superiors in the chain of      command.       Rumsfeld reacted in his usual direct fashion: he authorized      the establishment of a highly secret program that was given      blanket advance approval to kill or capture and, if possible,      interrogate ``high value'' targets in the Bush      Administration's war on terror. A special-access program, or      SAP--subject to the Defense Department's most stringent level      of security--was set up, with an office in a secure area of      the Pentagon. The program would recruit operatives and      acquire the necessary equipment, including aircraft, and      would keep its activities under wraps. America's most      successful intelligence operations during the Cold War had      been SAPs, including the Navy's submarine penetration of      underwater cables used by the Soviet high command and      construction of the Air Force's stealth bomber. All the so-     called ``black'' programs had one element in common: the      Secretary of Defense, or his deputy, had to conclude that the      normal military classification restraints did not provide      enough security.       ``Rumsfeld's goal was to get a capability in place to take      on a high-value target--a standup group to hit quickly,'' a      former high-level intelligence official told me. ``He got all      the agencies together--the C.I.A. and the N.S.A.--to get pre-     approval in place. Just say the code word and go.'' The      operation had across-the-board approval from Rumsfeld and      from Condoleezza Rice, the national-security adviser.      President Bush was informed of the existence of the program,      the former intelligence official said.       The people assigned to the program worked by the book, the      former intelligence official told me. They created code      words, and recruited, after careful screening, highly trained      commandos and operatives from America's elite forces--Navy      SEALs, the Army's Delta Force, and the C.I.A.'s paramilitary      experts. They also asked some basic questions: ``Do the      people working the problem have to use aliases? Yes. Do we      need dead drops for the mail? Yes. No traceability and no      budget. And some special-access programs are never fully      briefed to Congress.''       In theory, the operation enabled the Bush Administration to      respond immediately to time-sensitive intelligence: commandos      crossed borders without visas and could interrogate terrorism      suspects deemed too important for transfer to the military's      facilities at Guantanamo, Cuba. They carried out instant      interrogations--using force if necessary--at secret C.I.A.      detention centers scattered around the world. The      intelligence would be relayed to the SAP command center in      the Pentagon in real time, and sifted for those pieces of      information critical to the ``white,'' or overt, world.       Fewer than two hundred operatives and officials, including      Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint      Chiefs of Staff, were ``completely read into the program,''      the former intelligence official said. The goal was to keep      the operation protected. ``We're not going to read more      people than necessary into our heart of darkness,'' he said.      ``The rules are `Grab whom you must. Do what you want.'''       One Pentagon official who was deeply involved in the      program was Stephen Cambone, who was named Under-Secretary of      Defense for Intelligence in March, 2003. The office was new;      it was created as part of Rumsfeld's reorganization of the      Pentagon. Cambone was unpopular among military and civilian      intelligence bureaucrats in the Pentagon, essentially because      he had little experience in running intelligence programs,      though in 1998 he had served as staff director for a      committee, headed by Rumsfeld, that warned of an emerging      ballistic-missile threat to the United States. He was known      instead for his closeness to Rumsfeld. ``Remember Henry II--     `Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?''' the senior      C.I.A. official said to me, with a laugh, last week.      ``Whatever Rumsfeld whimsically says, Cambone will do ten      times that much.''       Cambone was a strong advocate for war against Iraq. He      shared Rumsfeld's disdain for the analysis and assessments      proffered by the C.I.A., viewing them as too cautious, and      chafed, as did Rumsfeld, at the C.I.A.'s inability, before      the Iraq war, to state conclusively that Saddam Hussein      harbored weapons of mass destruction. Cambone's military      assistant, Army Lieutenant General William G. (Jerry)      Boykin, was also controversial. Last fall, he generated      unwanted headlines after it was reported that, in a speech      at an Oregon church, he equated the Muslim world with      Satan.       Early in his tenure, Cambone provoked a bureaucratic battle      within the Pentagon by insisting that he be given control of      all special-access programs that were relevant to the war on      terror. Those programs, which had been viewed by many in the      Pentagon as sacrosanct, were monitored by Kenneth      deGraffenreid, who had experience in counter-intelligence      programs. Cambone got control, and deGraffenreid subsequently      left      the Pentagon. Asked for comment on this story, a Pentagon      spokesman said, ``I will not discuss any covert programs;      however, Dr. Cambone did not assume his position as the      Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence until March 7,      2003, and had no involvement in the decision-making process      regarding interrogation procedures in Iraq or anywhere      else.''       In mid-2003, the special-access program was regarded in the      Pentagon as one of the success stories of the war on terror.      ``It was an active program,'' the former intelligence      official told me. ``It's been the most important capability      we have for dealing with an imminent threat. If we discover      where Osama bin Laden is, we can get him. And we can remove      an existing threat with a real capability to hit the United      States--and do so without visibility.'' Some of its methods      were troubling and could not bear close scrutiny, however.       By then, the war in Iraq had begun. The SAP was involved in      some assignments in Iraq, the former official said. C.I.A.      and other American Special Forces operatives secretly teamed      up to hunt for Saddam Hussein and--without success--for Iraqi      weapons of mass destruction. But they weren't able to stop      the evolving insurgency.       In the first months after the fall of Baghdad, Rumsfeld and      his aides still had a limited view of the insurgency, seeing      it as little more than the work of Baathist ``dead-enders,''      criminal gangs, and foreign terrorists who were Al Qaeda      followers. The Administration measured its success in the war      by how many of those on its list of the fifty-five most      wanted members of the old regime--reproduced on playing      cards--had been captured. Then, in August, 2003, terror      bombings in Baghdad hit the Jordanian Embassy, killing      nineteen people, and the United Nations headquarters, killing      twenty-three people, including Sergio Vieira de Mello, the      head of the U.N. mission. On August 25th, less than a week      after the U.N. bombing, Rumsfeld acknowledged, in a talk      before the Veterans of Foreign Wars, that ``the dead-enders      are still with us.'' He went on, ``There are some today who      are surprised that there are still pockets of resistance in      Iraq, and they suggest that this represents some sort of      failure on the part of the Coalition. But this is not the      case.'' Rumsfeld compared the insurgents with those true      believers who ``fought on during and after the defeat of the      Nazi regime in Germany.'' A few weeks later--and five months      after the fall of Baghdad--the Defense Secretary declared,      ``It is, in my view, better to be dealing with terrorists in      Iraq than in the United States.''       Inside the Pentagon, there was a growing realization that      the war was going badly. The increasingly beleaguered and      baffled Army leadership was telling reporters that the      insurgents consisted of five thousand Baathists loyal to      Saddam Hussein. ``When you understand that they're organized      in a cellular structure,'' General Jon Abizaid, the head of      the Central Command declared, ``that . . . they have access      to a lot of money and a lot of ammunition, you'll understand      how dangerous they are.''       The American military and intelligence communities were      having little success in penetrating the insurgency. One      internal report prepared for the U.S. military, made      available to me, concluded that the insurgents' ``strategic      and operational intelligence has proven to be quite good.''      According to the study:       Their ability to attack convoys, other vulnerable targets      and particular individuals has been the result of painstaking      surveillance and reconnaissance. Inside information has been      passed on to insurgent cells about convoy/troop movements and      daily habits of Iraqis working with coalition from within the      Iraqi security services, primarily the Iraqi Police force      which is rife with sympathy for the insurgents, Iraqi      ministries and from within pro-insurgent individuals working      with the CPA's so-called Green Zone.       The study concluded, ``Politically, the U.S. has failed to      date. Insurgencies can be fixed or ameliorated by dealing      with what caused them in the first place. The disaster that      is the reconstruction of Iraq has been the key cause of the      insurgency. There is no legitimate government, and it      behooves the Coalition Provisional Authority to absorb the      sad but unvarnished fact that most Iraqis do not see the      Governing Council''--the Iraqi body appointed by the C.P.A.--     ``as the legitimate authority. Indeed, they know that the      true power is the CPA.''       By the fall, a military analyst told me, the extent of the      Pentagon's political and military misjudgments was clear.      Donald Rumsfeld's ``dead-enders'' now included not only      Baathists but many marginal figures as well--thugs and      criminals who were among the tens of thousands of prisoners      freed the previous fall by Saddam as part of a prewar general      amnesty. Their desperation was not driving the insurgency; it      simply made them easy recruits for those who were. The      analyst said, ``We'd killed and captured guys who had been      given two or three hundred dollars to `pray and spray' ''--     that is, shoot randomly and hope for the best. ``They weren't      really insurgents but down-and-outers who were paid by      wealthy individuals sympathetic to the insurgency.'' In many      cases, the paymasters were Sunnis who had been members of the      Baath Party. The analyst said, that the insurgents ``spent      three of four months figuring out how we operated and      developing their own countermeasures. If that meant putting      up a hapless guy to go and attack a convoy and see how the      American troops responded, they'd do it.'' Then, the analyst      said.``the clever ones began to get in on the action.''       By contrast, according to the military report, the American      and Coalition forces knew little about the insurgency:      ``Human intelligence is poor or lacking . . . due to the      dearth of competence and expertise. . . . The intelligence      effort is not coordinated since either too many groups are      involved in gathering intelligence or the final product does      not get to the troops in the field in a timely manner.'' The      success of the war was at risk; something had to be done to      change the dynamic.       The solution, endorsed by Rumsfeld and carried out by      Stephen Cambone, was to get tough with those Iraqis in the      Army prison system who were suspected of being insurgents. A      key player was Major General Geoffrey Miller, the commander      of the detention and interrogation center at Guantanamo, who      had been summoned to Baghdad in late August to review prison      interrogation procedures. The internal Army report on the      abuse charges, written by Major General Antonio Taguba in      February, revealed that Miller urged that the commanders in      Baghdad change policy and place military intelligence in      charge of the prison. The report quoted Miller as      recommending that ``detention operations must act as an      enabler for interrogation.''       Miller's concept, as it emerged in recent Senate hearings,      was to ``Gitmoize'' the prison system in Iraq--to make it      more focussed on interrogation. He also briefed military      commanders in Iraq on the interrogation methods used in      Cuba--methods that could, with special approval, include      sleep deprivation, exposure to extremes of cold, and heat,      and placing prisoners in ``stress positions'' for agonizing      lengths of time. (The Bush Administration had unilaterally      declared Al Qaeda and other captured members of international      terrorist networks to be illegal combatants, and not eligible      for the protection of the Geneva Conventions.)       Rumsfeld and Cambone went a step further, however: they      expanded the scope of the SAP, bringing its unconventional      methods to Abu Ghraib. The commandos were to operate in Iraq      as they had in Afghanistan. The male prisoners could be      treated roughly, and exposed to sexual humiliation.       ``They weren't getting anything substantive from the      detainees in Iraq,'' the former intelligence official told      me. ``No names. Nothing that they could hang their hat on.      Cambone says, I've got to crack this thing and I'm tired of      working through the normal chain of command. I've got this      apparatus set up--the black special-access program--and I'm      going in hot. So he pulls the switch, and the electricity      begins flowing last summer. And it's working. We're getting a      picture of the insurgency in Iraq and the intelligence is      flowing into the white world. We're getting good stuff. But      we've got more targets''--prisoners in Iraqi jails--``than      people who can handle them.''       Cambone then made another crucial decision, the former      intelligence official told me: not only would he bring the      SAP's rules into the prisons; he would bring some of the Army      military-intelligence officers working inside the Iraqi      prisons under the SAP's auspices. ``So here are fundamentally      good soldiers--military-intelligence guys--being told that no      rules apply,'' the former official, who has extensive      knowledge of the special-access programs, added. ``And, as      far as they're concerned, this is a covert operation, and      it's to be kept within Defense Department channels.''       The military-police prison guards, the former official      said, included ``recycled hillbillies from Cumberland,      Maryland.'' He was referring to members of the 372nd Military      Police Company. Seven members of the company are now facing      charges for their role in the abuse at Abu Ghraib. ``How are      these guys from Cumberland going to know anything? The Army      Reserve doesn't know what it's doing.''       Who was in charge of Abu Ghraib--whether military police or      military intelligence--was no longer the only question that      mattered. Hard-core special operatives, some of them with      aliases, were working in the prison. The military police      assigned to guard the prisoners wore uniforms, but many      others--military intelligence officers, contract      interpreters, C.I.A. officers, and the men from the special-     access program--wore civilian clothes. It was not clear who      was who, even to Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, then the      commander of the 800th Military Police Brigade, and the      officer ostensibly in charge. ``I thought most of the      civilians there were interpreters, but there were some      civilians that I didn't know,'' Karpinski told me. ``I called      them the disappearing ghosts. I'd seen them once in a while      at Abu Ghraib and then I'd see them months later. They were      nice--they'd always call out to me and say, `Hey, remember      me? How are you doing?''' The mysterious civilians, she said,      were ``always bringing in somebody for interrogation or      waiting to collect somebody going out.'' Karpinski added that      she had no idea who was operating in her prison system.      (General Taguba found that Karpinski's leadership failures      contributed to the abuses.)       By fall, according to the former intelligence official, the      senior leadership of the C.I.A. had had enough. ``They said,      `No way. We signed up for the core program in Afghanistan--     pre-approved for operations against high-value terrorist      targets--and now you want to use it for cabdrivers, brothers-     in-law, and people pulled off the      streets' ''--the sort of prisoners who populate the Iraqi      jails. ``The C.I.A.'s legal people objected,'' and the agency      ended its SAP involvement in Abu Ghraib, the former official      said.       The C.I.A.'s complaints were echoed throughout the      intelligence community. There was fear that the situation at      Abu Ghraib would lead to the exposure of the secret SAP, and      thereby bring an end to what had been, before Iraq, a      valuable cover operation. ``This was stupidity,'' a      government consultant told me. ``You're taking a program that      was operating in the chaos of Afghanistan against Al      Qaeda, a stateless terror group, and bringing it into a      structured, traditional war zone. Sooner or later, the      commandos would bump into the legal and moral procedures      of a conventional war with an Army of a hundred and      thirty-five thousand soldiers.''       The former senior intelligence official blamed hubris for      the Abu Ghraib disaster. ``There's nothing more exhilarating      for a pissant Pentagon civilian than dealing with an      important national security issue without dealing with      military planners, who are always worried about risk,'' he      told me. ``What could be more boring than needing the      cooperation of logistical planners?'' The only difficulty,      the former official added, is that, ``as soon as you enlarge      the secret program beyond the oversight capability of      experienced people, you lose control. We've never had a case      where a special-access program went sour--and this goes back      to the Cold War.''       In a separate interview, a Pentagon consultant, who spent      much of his career directly involved with special-access      programs, spread the blame. ``The White House subcontracted      this to the Pentagon, and the Pentagon subcontracted it to      Cambone,'' he said. ``This is Cambone's deal, but Rumsfeld      and Myers approved the program.'' When it came to the      interrogation operation at Abu Ghraib, he said, Rumsfeld left      the details to Cambone. Rumsfeld may not be personally      culpable, the consultant added, ``but he's responsible for      the checks and balances. The issue is that, since 9/11, we've      changed the rules on how we deal with terrorism, and created      conditions where the ends justify the means.''       Last week, statements made by one of the seven accused      M.P.s, Specialist Jeremy Sivits, who is expected to plead      guilty, were released. In them, he claimed that senior      commanders in his unit would have stopped the abuse had they      witnessed it. One of the questions that will be explored at      any trial, however, it why a group of Army Reserve military      policemen, most of them from small towns, tormented their      prisoners as they did, in a manner that was especially      humiliating for Iraqi men.       The notion that Arabs are particularly vulnerable to sexual      humiliation became a talking point among pro-war Washington      conservatives in the months before the March, 2003, invasion      of Iraq. One book that was frequently cited was ``The Arab      Mind,'' a study of Arab culture and psychology, first      published in 1973, by Raphael Patai, a cultural      anthropologist who taught at, among other universities,      Columbia and Princeton, and who died in 1996. The book      includes a twenty-five-page chapter on Arabs and sex,      depicting sex as a taboo vested with shame and repression.      ``The segregation of the sexes, the veiling of the women . .      . and all the other minute rules that govern and restrict      contact between men and women, have the effect of making sex      a prime mental preoccupation in the Arab world,'' Patai      wrote. Homosexual activity, ``or any indication of homosexual      leanings, as with all other expressions of sexuality, is      never given any publicity. These are private affairs and      remain in private.'' The Patai book, an academic told me, was      ``the bible of the neocons on Arab behavior.'' In their      discussions, he said, two themes emerged--``one, that Arabs      only understand force and, two, that the biggest weakness of      Arabs is shame and humiliation.''       The government consultant said that there may have been a      serious goal, in the beginning, behind the sexual humiliation      and the posed photographs. It was thought that some prisoners      would do anything--including spying on their associates--to      avoid dissemination of the shameful photos to family and      friends. The government consultant said, ``I was told that      the purpose of the photographs was to create an army of      informants, people you could insert back in the population.''      The idea was that they would be motivated by fear of      exposure, and gather information about pending insurgency      action, the consultant said. If so, it wasn't effective; the      insurgency continued to grow.       ``This shit has been brewing for months,'' the Pentagon      consultant who has dealt with SAPs told me. ``You don't keep      prisoners naked in their cell and then let them get bitten by      dogs. This is sick.'' The consultant explained that he and      his colleagues, all of whom had served for years on active      duty in the military, had been appalled by the misuse of Army      guard dogs inside Abu Ghraib. ``We don't raise kids to do      things like that. When you go after Mullah Omar, that's one      thing. But when you give the authority to kids who don't know      the rules, that's another.''       In 2003, Rumsfeld's apparent disregard for the requirements      of the Geneva Conventions while carrying out the war on      terror had led a group of senior military legal officers from      the Judge Advocate General's (JAG) Corps to pay two surprise      visits within five months to Scott Horton, who was then      chairman of the New York City Bar Association's Committee on      International Human Rights. ``They wanted us to challenge the      Bush Administration about its standards for detentions and      interrogation,'' Horton told me. ``They were urging us to get      involved and speak in a very loud voice. It came pretty much      out the blue. The message was that conditions are ripe for      abuse, and it's going to occur.'' The military officials were      most alarmed about the growing use of civilian contractors in      the interrogation process, Horton recalled. ``They said there      was an atmosphere of legal ambiguity being created as a      result of a policy decision at the highest levels in the      Pentagon. The JAG officers were being cut out of the policy      formulation process.'' They told him that, with the war on      terror, a fifty-year history of exemplary application of the      Geneva Conventions had come to an end.       The abuses at Abu Ghraib were exposed on January 13th, when      Joseph Darby, a young military policeman assigned to Abu      Gharib, reported the wrongdoing to the Army's Criminal      Investigations Division. He also turned over a CD full of      photographs. Within three days, a report made its way to      Donald Rumsfeld, who informed President Bush.       The inquiry presented a dilemma for the Pentagon. The      C.I.D. had to be allowed to continue, the former intelligence      official said. ``You can't cover it up. You have to prosecute      these guys for being off the reservation. But how do you      prosecute them when they were covered by the special-access      program? So you hope that maybe it'll go away.'' The      Pentagon's attitude last January, he said, was ``Somebody got      caught with some photos. What's the big deal? Take care of      it.'' Rumsfeld's explanation to the White House, the official      added, was reassuring. ``We've got a glitch in the program.      We'll prosecute it.' The cover story was that some kids got      out of control.''       In their testimony before Congress last week, Rumsfeld and      Cambone struggled to convince the legislators that Miller's      visit to Baghdad in late August had nothing to do with the      subsequent abuse. Cambone sought to assure the Senate Armed      Services Committee that the interplay between Miller and      Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, the top U.S. commander in      Iraq, had only a casual connection to his office. Miller's      recommendations, Cambone said, were made to Sanchez. His own      role, he said, was mainly to insure that the ``flow of      intelligence back to the commands'' was ``efficient and      effective.'' He added that Miller's goal was ``to provide a      safe, secure and humane environment that supports the      expeditious collection of intelligence.''       It was a hard sell. Senator Hillary Clinton, Democrat of      New York, posed the essential question facing the senators:       If, indeed General Miller was sent from Guantanamo to Iraq      for the purpose of acquiring more actionable intelligence      from detainees, then it is fair to conclude that the actions      that are at point here in you report [on abuses at Abu      Ghraib] are in some way connected to General Miller's arrival      and his specific orders, however they were interpreted, by      those MPs and the military intelligence that were involved. .      . . Therefore, I for one don't believe I yet have adequate      information from Mr. Cambone and the Defense Department as to      exactly what General Miller's orders were . . . how he      carried out those orders, and the connection between his      arrival in the fall of '03 and the intensity of the abuses      that occurred afterward.       Sometime before the Abu Ghraib abuses became public, the      former intelligence official told me, Miller was ``read      in''--that is, briefed--on the special-access operation. In      April, Miller returned to Baghdad to assume control of the      Iraqi prisons; once the scandal hit, with its glaring      headlines, General Sanchez presented him to the American and      international media as the general who would clean up the      Iraqi prison system and instill respect for the Geneva      Conventions. ``His job is to save what he can,'' the former      official said. ``He's there to protect the program while      limiting any loss of core capability.'' As for Antonio      Taguba, the former intelligence official added, ``He goes      into it not knowing shit. And then: ``Holy cow! What's going      on?       If General Miller had been summoned by Congress to testify,      he, like Rumsfeld and Cambone, would not have been able to      mention the special-access program. ``If you give away the      fact that a special-access program exists,'' the former      intelligence official told me, ``you blow the whole quick-     reaction program.''       One puzzling aspect of Rumsfeld's account of his initial      reaction to news of the Abu Ghraib investigation was his lack      of alarm and lack of curiosity. One factor may have been      recent history: there had been many previous complaints of      prisoner abuse from organizations like Human Rights Watch and      the International Red Cross, and the Pentagon had weathered      them with ease. Rumsfeld told the Senate Armed Services      Committee that he had not been provided with details of      alleged abuses until late March, when he read the specific      charges. ``You read it, as I say, it's one thing. You see      these photographs and it's just unbelievable. . . . It wasn't      three-dimensional. It wasn't video. It wasn't color. it was      quite a different thing.'' The former intelligence official      said that in his view, Rumsfeld and other senior Pentagon      officials had not studied the photographs because ``they      thought what was in there was permitted under the rules of      engagement,'' as applied to the SAP. ``The photos,'' he      added, ``turned out to be the result of the program run      amok.''        The former intelligence official made it clear that he was      not alleging that Rumsfeld or General Myers knew that      atrocities were committed. But, he said, ``it was their      permission granted to do the SAP, generically, and there was      enough ambiguity, which permitted the abuses.''       Thsi official went on, ``The black guys''--those in the      Pentagon's secret program--``say we've got to accept the      prosecution. they're vaccinated from the reality.'' The SAP      is still active, and ``the United States is picking up guys      for interrogation. The question is, how do they protect the      quick-reaction force without blowing its cover?'' The program      was protected by the fact that no one on the outside was      allowed to know of its existence. ``If you even give a hint      that you're aware of a black program that you're not read      into, you lose your clearances,'' the former official said.      ``Nobody will talk. So the only people left to prosecute are      those who are undefended--the poor kids at the end of the      food chain.''       The most vulnerable senior official is Cambone. ``The      Pentagon is trying now to protect Cambone, and doesn't know      how to do it,'' the former intelligence official said.       Last week, the government consultant, who has close ties to      many conservatives, defended the Administration's continued      secrecy about the special-access program in Abu Ghraib.;      ``Why keep it black?'' the consultant asked. ``Because the      process is unpleasant. It's like making sausage--you like the      result but you don't want to know how it was made. Also, you      don't want the Iraqi public, and the Arab world, to know.      Remember, we went to Iraq to democratize the Middle East. The      last thing you want to do is let the Arab world know how you      treat Arab males in prison.''       The former intelligence official told me he feared that one      of the disastrous effects of the prison-abuse scandal would      be the undermining of legitimate operations in the war on      terror, which had already suffered from the draining of      resources into Iraq. He portrayed Abu Ghraib as a ``a tumor''      on the war on terror. He said, ``As long as it's benign and      contained, the Pentagon can deal with the photo crisis      without jeopardizing the secret program. As soon as it begins      to grow, with nobody to diagnose it--it becomes a malignant      tumor.''       The Pentagon consultant made a similar point. Cambone and      his superiors, the consultant said, ``created the conditions      that allowed transgressions to take place. And now we're      going to end up with another Church Commission''--the 1975      Senate committee on intelligence, headed by Senator Frank      Church, of Idaho, which investigated C.I.A. abuses during the      previous two decades. Abu Ghraib had sent the message that      the Pentagon leadership was unable to handle its      discretionary power. ``When the shit hits the fan, as it did      on 9/11, how do you push the pedal?'' the consultant asked.      ``You do it selectively and with intelligence.''       ``Congress is going to get to the bottom of this,'' the      Pentagon consultant said. ``You have to demonstrate that      there are checks and balances in the system.'' He added,      ``When you live in a world of gray zones, you have to have      very clear red lines.'''       Senator John McCain, of Arizona, said, ``If this is true,      it certainly increases the dimension of this issue and      deserves significant scrutiny. I will do all possible to get      to the bottom of this, and all other allegations.''       ``In an odd way,'' Kenneth Roth, the executive director of      Human Rights Watch, said, ``the sexual abuses at Abu Ghraib      have become a diversion for the prisoner abuse and the      violation of the Geneva Conventions that is authorized.''      Since September 11th, Roth added, the military has      systematically used third-degree techniques around the world      on detainees. ``Some JAGS hate this and are horrified that      the tolerance of mistreatment will come back and haunt us in      the next war,'' Roth told me. ``We're giving the world a      ready-made excuse to ignore the Geneva Conventions. Rumsfeld      has lowered the bar.''",1,

They must also understand that      what took place in that prison does not represent America      that I know. The America I know is a compassionate country      that believes in freedom. The America I know cares about      every individual. The America I know has sent troops into      Iraq to promote freedom--good, honorable citizens that are      helping the Iraqis every day.'';       Whereas in that interview the President further stated      ``It's also important for the people of Iraq to know that in      a democracy, everything is not perfect, that mistakes are      made. But in a democracy, as well, those mistakes will be      investigated and people will be brought to justice. We're an      open society. We're a society that is willing to investigate,      fully investigate in this case, what took place in that      prison. That stands in stark contrast to life under Saddam      Hussein. His trained torturers were never brought to justice      under his regime. There were no investigations about      mistreatment of people. There will be investigations.

Mr. Rumsfeld said he made his decision to hold a suspected      combatant out of the sight of international monitors when he      was asked to do so last October by George Tenet, director of      the Central Intelligence Agency. He suggested, without      elaborating, that concealing detainees from Red Cross      monitors is done from time to time, despite international      conventions that forbid it. ``There are instances where that      occurs,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said.       But the secretary bristled at what he said was an attempt      to link the decision he made in the case of the ``ghost      detainee'' with the scandal at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq,      where a handful of low-ranking U.S. soldiers stand accused of      abusing prisoners. ``The implication that's out there is the      United States government is engaging in torture as a matter      of policy, and that's not true,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said, adding      he has seen no evidence that senior Pentagon officials were      complicit in the abuse at Abu Ghraib or elsewhere.       An Army general assigned to investigate abusers at Abu      Gharaib prison, Antonio Taguba, criticized the military for      housing what he called ``ghost detainees'' for the CIA,      saying in a report that the practice was ``deceptive,      contrary to Army Doctrine, and in violation of international      law.''       Mr. Rumsfeld's comments to the press came a few hours after      President Bush told reporters he remained confident in his      appointee. Mr. Bush said he hadn't previously known about the      detainee who was held incommunicado. ``I'm never disappointed      in my secretary of defense,'' Mr. Bush said. ``He's doing a      fabulous job and America's lucky to have him in the position      he's in.''       But nearly every day for the past month the Bush      administration has found itself on the defensive about      treatment of detainees in Iraq or Afghanistan. In      Afghanistan, the U.S. Army is investigating several      suspicious detainee deaths. Yesterday, a federal grand jury      indicted a CIA civilian contractor in one of the cases. David      A. Passaro, described by a CIA spokesman as a retired Army      special forces officer on contract to the agency, was charged      with beating an Afghani to death with a flashlight last      summer. The indictment said Mr. Passaro murdered a detainee      who had turned himself in to military forces at Asadabad      military base.       Investigators have said they are looking into three      prisoner deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan that may have come at      the hands of CIA agents or their proxies. The CIA said Mr.      Passaro's relationship with the agency was a short one. He      signed a contract to work for the agency in December 2002 and      arrived in Afghanistan in mid-May. The alleged murder      occurred the following month.       ``We take allegations of wrongdoing very seriously, and      it's important to bear in mind that CIA immediately reported      this allegation to the [CIA] inspector general,'' said      spokesman Mark Mansfield.       The case of the ghost detainee doesn't involve abuse      allegations. CIA and Pentagon officials say the man was      captured last June in northern Iraq and spirited out of the      country by CIA operatives. When the Justice Department ruled      several months later that the man shouldn't have been taken      from Iraq, he was returned and placed in the custody of the      U.S. Army.       According to two U.S. officials, the CIA asked that the man      be held without an identifying serial number because making      his arrest public might hinder an ongoing operation. Because      his case wasn't recorded in Pentagon prisoner files, however,      U.S. officials acknowledged they lost track of him for a      time. He resurfaced in May when senior Pentagon officials got      wind of his case. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the      man will soon be issued an identifying number, and placed in      the general prison population in Iraq if the CIA voices no      objections.",1,
