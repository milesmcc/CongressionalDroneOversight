  CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS",,0,,MASSACH,6,,"House Republican Leader John Boehner, the Ohio Republican with his eye on Speaker Nancy Pelosi's gavel, said the tide is turning the GOP's way. ``The American people have written off the Democrats,'' Boehner said Monday in an interview with Tribune-Review editors and reporters. ``They're willing to look at us again.'' Boehner stopped short of predicting Republicans would gain the 39 seats they need to retake control of Congress, but he said a backlash against President Obama's policies has energized Republican voters more than Democrats. Boehner said voters are angry at a government they believe is overreaching and indifferent. University of Virginia political scientist Isaac Wood said excitement among tea party protesters might not carry over to the electorate as a whole. ``While the enthusiasm of tea party types may drive them to the polls and boost Republicans, it does not yet seem that huge waves of new voters will be flocking to the polls,'' Wood said. Boehner said the protests are emblematic of deep voter anger against Washington's leaders. ``They're snuffing out the America that I grew up in,'' Boehner said. ``Right now, we've got more Americans engaged in their government than at any time in our history. There's a political rebellion brewing, and I don't think we've seen anything like it since 1776.'' The health care law passed in March ``pushed most Americans over the edge,'' Boehner said. If Republicans retake control of the House, Boehner promised a vote on a bill repealing the health care law and replacing it with a scaled-down package of tax breaks and court reforms. Democrats likely would maintain control of the Senate, and Obama could veto the proposal, all but eliminating its chances of succeeding. ``We are going to do everything we can to make sure that this law and this program never really takes effect,'' Boehner said. One option would be to repeal the $534 billion in Medicare cuts, which pay for more than half of the law's provisions. ``They're going to need money from the Congress to hire these 20,000-plus bureaucrats they need to hire to make this program work. They're not going to get one dime from us.'' Boehner criticized the financial regulatory overhaul compromise reached last week between House and Senate negotiators as an overreaction to the financial crisis that triggered the recession. The bill would tighten restrictions on lending, create a consumer protection agency with broad oversight power and give the government an orderly way to dissolve the largest financial institutions if they run out of money. ``This is killing an ant with a nuclear weapon,'' Boehner said. What's most needed is more transparency and better enforcement by regulators, he said. Allan H. Meltzer, a political economy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said the financial bill ``does nothing to restore integrity to the mortgage market by correcting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the bill does not eliminate `too big to fail.' '' Boehner said Obama overreacted to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The spill might warrant a ``pause'' in deepwater drilling, but Obama's blanket ban on drilling in the gulf--which a judge overturned last week--could devastate the region's economy, he said. Louisiana State University scientists estimate the ban could have affected more than 10,000 jobs. Boehner had praise, however, for Obama's troop surge in Afghanistan and stepped-up drone attacks in Pakistan. He declined to list any benchmarks he has for measuring progress in the nine-year war, at a time of increasing violence and Obama's replacement of Gen. Stanley McChrystal with Gen. David Petraeus. Ensuring there's enough money to pay for the war will require reforming the country's entitlement system, Boehner said. He said he'd favor increasing the Social Security retirement age to 70 for people who have at least 20 years until retirement, tying cost-of-living increases to the consumer price index rather than wage inflation and limiting payments to those who need them. ``We need to look at the American people and explain to them that we're broke,'' Boehner said. ``If you have substantial non-Social Security income while you're retired, why are we paying you at a time when we're broke? We just need to be honest with people.''",,1,1,0,0,,0,111,187,1,0,0,6/30/10,3,0,{u'REFERENCE': 0},0,0,0,1.4218839768026155,,,,1,965,1.4218839768026155

According to intelligence, Iraq has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of the 150 kilometer restriction imposed by the United Nations in the ceasefire resolution. Although Iraq's chemical weapons capability was reduced during the UNSCOM inspections, Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort over the last 4 years. Evidence suggests that it has begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including mustard gas, sarin, cyclosarin, and VX. Intelligence reports show that Iraq has invested more heavily in its biological weapons programs over the 4 years, with the result that all key aspects of this program--R, production and weaponization--are active. Most elements of the program are larger and more advanced than they were before the gulf war. Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating agents and is capable of quickly producing and weaponizing a variety of such agents, including anthrax, for delivery on a range of vehicles such as bombs, missiles, aerial sprayers, and covert operatives which could bring them to the United States homeland. Since inspectors left, the Iraqi regime has energized its missile program, probably now consisting of a few dozen Scud-type missiles with ranges of 650 to 900 kilometers that could hit Israel, Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the region. In addition, Iraq is developing unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs, capable of delivering chemical and biological warfare agents, which could threaten Iraq's neighbors as well as American forces in the Persian Gulf.",,1,0,0,0,,0,107,86,0,0,0,10/9/02,3,0,{u'FOREIGNUSE': -1},1,0,0,0.11371581814886925,,,,1,443,0.11371581814886925

The article identifies White House Counterterrorism Chief John Brennan as the official assuming the role of Obama's de facto assassination czar, raising concerns even within the Obama administration that the White House is increasingly turning into ``a pseudo-military headquarters'' under the direction of just a few senior Obama administration officials. Adding to these concerns are serious questions about Brennan's qualification for this role. Even before the 2008 election, eyebrows were raised over Brennan's role in the Obama campaign. An employee of The Analysis Corporation, of which Brennan was CEO, had improperly accessed passport information for Hillary Clinton, Obama's Democratic primary challenger at the time, and GOP nominee John McCain. At the time, Brennan was a top adviser to the Obama campaign, and Brennan's employee was not fired. One of the key witnesses in the case was found murdered in his car outside his church while the investigation was still ongoing. Brennan was involved in administration intrigue related to the release of convicted Libyan Pan Am Flight 103 bomber from a Scottish jail in August 2009. At the time of Megrahi's release, when he returned to Libya to a national hero's welcome, Brennan described the release as ``unfortunate, inappropriate, and wrong'' and called for his reimprisonment. However, Obama administration documents obtained by The Sunday Times revealed that the White House had secretly informed Scottish authorities that they found compassionate release more palatable than the reimprisonment of Megrahi in Libya.

As Members of this Administration have previously indicated, the U.S. government has not carried out drone strikes in the United States and has no intention of doing so. As a policy matter, moreover, we reject the use of military force where well-established law enforcement authorities in this country provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat. We have a long history of using the criminal justice system to incapacitate individuals located in our country who pose a threat to the United States and its interests abroad. Hundreds of individuals have been arrested and convicted of terrorism-related offenses in our Federal courts. The question you have posed is therefore entirely hypothetical, unlikely to occur, and one we hope no President will ever have to confront. It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States. For example, the President could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the military to use such force if necessary to protect the homeland in the circumstances of a catastrophic attack like the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11,",,0,0,0,0,,0,113,1399,0,0,0,3/6/13,67,1,{},0,0,0,2.6260091847455245,,,0,0,533,2.6260091847455245

In an interview with The Associated Press, Campbell said that ``foreign fighters'' from Syria and Iraq had joined Afghans who had declared loyalty to the group in the eastern province of Nangarhar, bordering Pakistan. He said there were also ``indications'' that the IS supporters in Nangarhar were trying to consolidate links with the group's leadership in Syria and Iraq. The Islamic State group controls about a third of Iraq and Syria. Fighters loyal to the group in Afghanistan include disaffected Afghan and Pakistani Taliban who have fought fierce battles with the Taliban in recent months. Afghan officials have said that IS supporters control a number of border districts in Nangarhar and have a presence in some other southern provinces, including Zabul and Ghazni. Until now, however, it was unclear whether loyalists in Afghanistan had institutional links to the group's leadership. Many of those who had declared allegiance to IS were ``disenfranchised Taliban'' from both sides of the border, Campbell said. But, he added, ``they've been reaching out. I'm sure there are folks who have come from Syria and Iraq--I couldn't tell you how many but there are indications of some foreign fighters coming in there. ``But they don't have the capability right now to attack Europe, or attack the homeland, the United States. But that's what they want to do, they've said that's what they want to do,'' he said. During the summer months, Taliban and IS loyalists fought fierce battles in the far eastern districts of Nangarhar, with residents reporting a range of atrocities, including arbitrary imprisonment, forced marriages for young women, and beheadings. The IS loyalists have said they want to absorb Afghanistan into a larger province of its ``caliphate'' called Khorasan. Campbell said the group wants to establish a base in Nangarhar's provincial capital, Jalalabad ``as the base of the Khorasan province'' and ``work their way up into Kunar'' province immediately north. The first credible reports of an IS presence in Afghanistan emerged earlier this year in northern Helmand, though recruiters believed to have had links to the leadership in Syria were killed by U.S. drone strikes in February. The presence in Nangarhar became clear in the summer, when IS loyalists launched battles against the Taliban in the border regions. For months, the Afghan forces--occupied with fighting elsewhere--had let the two groups fight each other, Campbell said. ``If the Taliban and ISIL want to kill each other, let them do it,'' he said, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State group. He said that control of the four districts--Achin, Nazyan, Bati Kot and Spin Gar--had seesawed between the two groups. The revelation in July that the Taliban's founder and leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar had been dead for more than two years has led to deep fissures in the leadership, and infighting between rival Taliban factions that Campbell said had left hundreds dead. Campbell, who took control of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan in mid-2014, said splits among the Taliban, who have been trying to overthrow the Afghan government since their regime was driven from power in 2001 by the U.S. invasion, could make the fight even harder in 2016. ``The prize really is Kandahar, that's their strategic goal,'' he said, referring to the southern province from where the Taliban emerged after Afghanistan's vicious civil war ended in 1996. Neighboring Helmand province, where most of the world's opium is produced, is currently the scene of fierce battles for control of strategically important districts, including Marjah. Taliban fighters took control of the northern city of Kunduz in September, for just three days before the Afghan military, backed by U.S. forces, pushed them out. Campbell said he did not believe the Taliban had planned to hold or govern Kunduz, but the psychological impact of the city's fall had been enormous. Jalalabad, he said, ``is not going to fall.'' Afghan forces, ``challenged in many areas, understand the impact of Kunduz,'' he said. ``I think they will make the right adjustments so that it (Jalalabad) doesn't become another Kunduz.''",,,1,0,0,,0,114,,0,0,0,12/17/15,,,{u'REFERENCE': 0},0,0,0,,,,,0,,

Many of those challenging the administration on this issue are motivated more by politics than by policy. Some doing the challenging were strongly in favor of going to war against Iraq when it appeared politically popular to do so, but are now chagrined that the war is not going as smoothly as was hoped. I am sure once the alleged attempt to buy uranium is thoroughly debunked, the other excuses for going to war will be examined with a great deal of scrutiny as well. It is obvious that the evidence used to justify going to war is now less than convincing. The charge that Saddam Hussein had aluminum tubes used in manufacturing nuclear weapons was in error. A fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles capable of dispensing chemical and biological weapons did not exist. The 63,000 liters of anthrax and botulism have not been found, nor have any of the mobile germ labs. There are no signs of the 1 million pounds of sarin, mustard and VX gasses. No evidence has been revealed to indicate Iraq was a threat to anyone's security, let alone ours. The charge that Saddam Hussein was connected to the al Qaeda was wrong. Saddam Hussein's flaunting of the UN resolutions regarding weapons of mass destruction remains unproven. How could so many errors have occurred? Some say it was ineptness while others claim outright deception and lies. There are some who say it was selective use of intelligence to promote a particular policy already decided upon. This debate, I am sure, will rage on for a long time, and since motivations are subjective and hard to prove, resolving the controversy will be difficult. However, this should not diminish the importance of sorting out the truth from the fiction, the errors from the malice. One question, though, I hope gets asked is why should we use intelligence cited by a foreign government as a justification for going to war? One would think that with the billions we spend, we could fully rely on our own intelligence-gathering agencies. Another point of interest, lacking a coherent foreign policy, we have support for war coming from different groups depending on circumstances unrelated to national defense. For instance, those who strenuously objected to Kosovo promoted war in Iraq. And those who objected to Iraq are now anxious to send troops to Liberia. For some, U.N. permission is important and necessary. For others, the U.N. is helpful as long as it endorses the war they want. Only a few correctly look to the Constitution and to the Congress to sort out the pros and cons of each conflict and decide whether or not a declaration of war is warranted. The sad fact is that we have lost our way. A threat to national security is no longer a litmus test for sending troops hither and yon, and the American people no longer require Congress to declare the wars we fight. Hopefully, some day that will be changed. The raging debate over whether or not Saddam Hussein tried to buy uranium, as important as it is, distracts from the much more important strategic issue of what is the proper foreign policy in a republic. Hopefully, we will soon seriously consider the policy of noninterventionism in the affairs of others. Avoiding entangling alliances and staying out of the internal affairs of other nations is a policy most conducive to peace and prosperity and one the Founders endorsed.

But China doubtless exceeds both in resource commitment and breadth of artillery investments. Credited with an estimated 17,700-plus towed, self-propelled and rocket systems, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has at least 56 artillery systems in use, development or available for export. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps, by contrast, have 8,187-plus artillery pieces of roughly 10 types. China has had a mixed record of using artillery for military and political-military goals. Its successes as when it routed Indian forces in 1962 with the high-altitude use of artillery and mortars, have been offset by incidents provoking third-party responses or leading to regional standoffs. Examples include the shelling of islands controlled by Taiwan in 1955-58, resulting in U.S. intervention and a stalemate over the Taiwan Strait. In July, a unit based in the Nanjing military region fired missiles from 300-mm. PHL-03 multiple rocket launchers (MRLs) into the Yellow Sea to show China's anger at U.S. naval exercises with South Korea. The exercises, a result of China-backed North Korea's sinking of the South Korean frigate Cheonon in March, went ahead anyway. China evolution as an artillery power stems from Soviet and Russian influences dating to the Korean War Soviet artillery and training improved PLA artillery operations during the war and led to the formation of the first formal artillery command. Soviet aid continued through the 1950s, and by the time of the Sin-Soviet split of the 1960s, China was producing copies or modified versions of Soviet pieces. The PLA makes extensive use of Soviet-origin 152-, 130- and 122-mm. calibers, though Western calibers such as the 155- and 105-mm. are seeing greater use. China purchased the Russian 9A52 Smerch 300-mm. MRL in the 1990s, and the PLA produced a near facsimile in the A-100/PHL-03 MRL. The 155- mm. PLZ-05 self-propelled artillery system that emerged in 2005 bears an uncanny resemblance to the Russian 2519 MSTA. In the 1990s, PLA artillery was affected by reforms in strategy (its closest concept to doctrine) and organization. Toward the end of the decade, the PLA was immersed in strategy goals of ``informatization'' and ``mechanization.'' The former included the broad application of improving information technologies, which for artillery included new computer-based fire controls and ever-improving digital communication and command linkages. PLA artillery units increasingly include flrefinding counter-battery radar such as the 50-km.-range (31-mi.) SLC-2 and Type 704, and use sophisticated electronic warfare systems such as the Russian SPR-2 radio fuse jammer, a possible Chinese facsimile and possibly a recently revealed artillery radar jammer. Artillery recon vehicles and recon troops feature advanced optronic and digital communication capabilities. In addition, PLA artillery units have sophisticated meteorological capabilities and use muzzle velocity radar to improve accuracy. Mechanization put renewed emphasis on developing tracked and wheeled self-propelled tubed artillery, with rocket artillery largely truck-mounted. This trend was emphasized in late 2004 when Chinese Communist Party and PLA leader Hu Jintao enunciated the PLAs new ``historic missions,'' a euphemism for invasions, which call on the PLA to defend state interests abroad. It is likely that new medium-weight artillery systems based on airmobile armored personnel carriers will follow for these strategic missions. Organic PLA artillery units have decreased in size, following the pattern of general large-scale troop reductions. When combined with ``informatization'' advances, this will permit many infantry and armored divisions to be reformed into mechanized brigades. However, in a counter- trend that emphasizes their continued importance, the PLA maintains five independent artillery divisions and 20 independent brigades. Of these, two divisions and six brigades are stationed in the Shenyang and Beijing military regions, for potential Korean contingencies. Three divisions and eight brigades are in the Nanjing Guangzhou and Jinan military regions, for Taiwan contingencies. Among artillery systems, mortars include a 60-mm. hand-held system used by infantry and special forces. The new Type 93 60-mm. fixed mortar weighs 22.4 kg. (49.2 lb.) and fires 20 rounds/min. to 5.5 km. There are also fixed W91 and W87 81- mm. mortars that fire to 8 km. and 5.6 km., respectively. The PLA has largely copied Russia's Vasilyek 81-mm. automatic mortar, called the W99 or SM-4, which comes in a towed version or mounted in a Hummer-like vehicle. It fires four rounds in 2 sec. out to 6.2 km. The W86 120-mm. towed mortar weighs 206 kg. and fires 20 rounds/min. to 4.7 km. In 2001, the PLA revealed the PLL-05 mobile mortar based on the Russian 120-mm. 2S23 NONA-SVK that it purchased in the 1990s, but mounted on a WZ-551 6 X 6 armored personnel carrier (APC). It fires a rocket-assisted round 13.5 km. In 2007, the PLA revealed a laser-guided 120-mm. mortar round, though it is not clear if it is in service. Towed and self-propelled tubed systems dominate artillery units. The largest number of towed guns are likely the 122- mm. versions. These include the Type-96, based on the Russian D-30, with a 360-deg. traversing base, and the simpler Type- 83. Their rocket-assisted rounds have a 27-km. range. The Type-59 130-mm. towed gun fires a rocket-assisted round 44 km. Of heavy towed artillery, the 152-mm. Type-66, a copy of the Russian D-20, is most numerous and fires rocket-assisted rounds 28 km. In 1999, the PLA revealed the 155-mm. PLL01/WA 021 towed artillery system, based on the Austrian Noricum GH N-45, which fires a rocket-assisted round 50 km. The PLL01 and the Type-66 fire 155- and 152-mm. versions of the Russian Krasnopol laser-guided shell. Self-propelled tubed artillery includes the PLL02, which places the Type-86 100-mm. gun on a WZ-551 APC. In 2009, the PLA revealed the new Type-07 122-mm. tracked artillery system, which features hull and electronic improvements over the previous Type-89 Tracked 122-mm. system. In 2009, photographs appeared on the Internet of the SH-3, a truck- mounted 122-mm. artillery system with digital control systems in a hatch over the cab. Heavy self-propelled systems include the 155-mm. PLZ-05, which has a version of the PLL01 gun, and appeared in 2005. It is replacing the 152-mm. Type-83, which entered service in 1983. The PLZ-05 also fires the Krasnopol laser-guided projectile and a rocket-assisted round 50 km., and is capable of flat-trajectory antitank fire. Unconfirmed reports state the PLZ-05 has an automatic gun-loading system and weighs 35 tons. PLA investments in rocket artillery are impressive. A five- wheel all-terrain vehicle has been modified to carry a 107- mm. MRL for experimental mechanized special forces units. The tracked Type-89 and more recent Type-90 truck-mounted 122-mm. MRL feature self-contained 40-round rocket reloaders. In addition, the Smerch-derived 12-round PHL-03, which reportedly fires a 150-km.-range missile, is entering increasing numbers of artillery units. The latest AR1A export variant features a modular U.S. MLR system-style 5-round rocket carrier, which speeds reloading. In 2009, Norinco revealed an as yet unidentified truck carrier for this 5- round rocket box, similar to Lockheed Martin's High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System. The PLA is also investing in larger MRL systems. The 400- mm. WS-2D reportedly has a range of 400 km., and one payload features three ``killer unmanned aerial vehicles,'' according to a Chinese report. An earlier 200-km.-range version, the WS-3, uses navigation satellite guidance to achieve a remarkable 50-meter (164-ft.) circular error probable. The WS family complements the 150-km.-range P-12 and 250-km. B-611M maneuverable navsat-guided short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), which could supplement or replace the PLA's two brigades of 300-600-km. DF-11A SRBMs. New artillery systems are entering amphibious and airborne units for possible missions abroad. PLA marine and army amphibious units are receiving the Type-07B tracked 122-mm. amphibious artillery system, which places the gun from the Type-07 on a larger hull. Airborne units are equipped with a version of the Type-96 122-mm. gun, but a new tracked airmobile APC may feature a mortar or gun system. The ZBD-09 122-mm. gun system could eventually feature in airmobile army units. Future artillery systems may feature electromagnetic launch, an area of extensive research. The PLA is also interested in ramjet-powered and stealth-coated artillery shells.",,,1,0,0,,0,111,,0,0,0,9/29/10,,,{u'REFERENCE': 0},0,0,0,,,,,1,,

Aug 2010: Brennan storms out of meeting with Washington Times editorial staff after he claims he was misquoted by newspaper and editor begins reading Brennan's own quotes back to him out loud Sept 2010: Known HAMAS operative given escorted tour of National Counterterrorism Center May 2012: Brennan implicated in major White House intelligence breach involving UK/Saudi Al-Qaeda infiltrator Aug 2012: Brennan attacks critics of politically-driven White House intelligence leaks Sept 2012: House Intel Committee Chairman Mike Rogers says changes in CIA's Benghazi attack talking points blaming Mohammed video happened under deputies committee chaired by Brennan Again, these are just some of John Brennan's highlights. We could also add his laughable claims of no collateral casualties from his drone assassination program or his defense of trying Al-Qaeda operations chief Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in federal court or his role in the White House back-door dealing with the UK on the release of Libyan Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi or his reference to Jerusalem as ``Al-Quds'' in a NYU speech or his claims that the 20 percent recidivism rate for GITMO detainees (those who returned to terrorism) was ``not that bad''.

The elder, Tamerlan--apparently named for the 14th-century Muslim conqueror famous for building pyramids of his victims' skulls to commemorate his triumphs over infidels--is dead. The younger, Dzhokhar, will stand trial when his wounds heal, in a proceeding where the most likely uncertainty will be the penalty. No doubt there will be some legal swordplay over his interrogation by the FBI's High-Value Interrogation Group without receiving Miranda warnings. But the only downside for the government in that duel is that his statements may not be used against him at trial. This is not much of a risk when you consider the other available evidence, including photo images of him at the scene of the bombings and his own reported confession to the victim whose car he helped hijack during last week's terror in Boston. But if your concern is over the larger threat that inheres in who the Tsarnaev brothers were and are, what they did, and what they represent, then worry--a lot. For starters, you can worry about how the High-Value Interrogation Group, or HIG, will do its work. That unit was finally put in place by the FBI after so-called ``underwear bomber'' named Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to blow up the airplane in which he was traveling as it flew over Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009 and was advised of his Miranda rights. The CIA interrogation program that might have handled the interview had by then been dismantled by President Obama. At the behest of such Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated groups as the Council on American Islamic Relations and the Islamic Society of North America and other self-proclaimed spokesmen for American Muslims, the FBI has bowdlerized its training materials to exclude references to militant Islamism. Does this delicacy infect the FBI's interrogation group as well? Will we see another performance like the Army's after- action report following Major Nidal Hasan's rampage at Fort Hood in November 2009, preceded by his shout ``allahu akhbar''--a report that spoke nothing of militant Islam but referred to the incident as ``workplace violence''? If tone is set at the top, recall that the Army chief of staff at the time said the most tragic result of Fort Hood would be if it interfered with the Army's diversity program. Presumably, the investigation into the Boston terror attack will include inquiry into not only the immediate circumstances of the crimes but also who funded Tamerlan Tsarnaev's months-long sojourn abroad in 2012 and his comfortable lifestyle. Did he have a support network? What training did he, and perhaps his younger brother, receive in the use of weapons? Where did the elder of the two learn to make the suicide vest he reportedly wore? The investigation should include, as well, a deep dive into Tamerlan's radicalization, the Islamist references in the brothers' social media communications, and the jihadist Web sites they visited. Will the investigation probe as well the FBI's own questioning of Tamerlan 2 years ago at the behest of an unspecified foreign government, presumably Russia, over his involvement with jihadist Web sites and other activities? Tamerlan Tsarnaev is the fifth person since 9/11 who has participated in terror attacks after questioning by the FBI. He was preceded by Nidal Hasan; drone casualty Anwar al- Awlaki; Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad--born Carlos Leon Bledsoe--who murdered an Army recruit in Little Rock in June 2009; and David Coleman Headley, who provided intelligence to the perpetrators of the Mumbai massacre in 2008. That doesn't count Abdulmutallab, who was the subject of warnings to the CIA that he was a potential terrorist.",,0,1,0,0,,0,113,620,0,0,0,4/23/13,49,2,{u'REFERENCE': 0},0,0,0,0.98021947443521762,,,,1,937,0.98021947443521762
